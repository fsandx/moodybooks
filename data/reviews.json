Broken Glass, as his nickname suggests, is not the happiest of individuals, and this former teacher's thirst for bottled solace is matched by several other distressed and disgraced patrons of the bar. Broken Glass is a comic romp that releases Mabanckou's sense of humour, subtly restrained in his earlier novel African Psycho - narrated, as you might guess, by a would-be serial killer. Mabanckou knows his French literature (he teaches that subject at UCLA). Broken Glass is a whistlestop tour of French literature and civilisation, and if you don't know your Marivaux, your Chateaubriand, your ENAs and Weston shoes you'll miss a lot of the gags (\"a quarrel of Brest\", anyone?) - but don't worry, there are still plenty left.It's not just French writers who make an appearance. That arch navel-gazer Holden Caulfield (or someone claiming to be him) has a walk-on part, and Broken Glass ends \"we'll meet again, in the other world, Holden, we'll have a drink together ... I'll tell you what they do with the poor little ducks in cold countries during winter time.\"Although its cultural and intertextual musings could fuel innumerable doctorates, the real meat of Broken Glass is its comic brio, and Mabanckou's jokes work the whole spectrum of humour. Take these lines, which could have come from one of Alan Coren's 1970s Idi Amin dispatches: \"The Prime Minister promised in the next reshuffle the Minister for Agriculture would be given the portfolio for Culture, all you had to do was cross out the first four letters of 'agriculture'.\" There is a pissing-contest that Rabelais would be proud of (and a stream of scatological schtick). There are also a number of characters who criss-cross the frontier between tragedy and comedy: the Printer, for example, who boasts \"I did France\", having married a white woman and enjoyed a comfortable managerial position at the printing works that produced Paris-Match. Washed-up and penniless, he now sits in the Credit Gone Away relating to any ear that will listen how his wife had an affair with his son and foisting copies of Paris-Match on his interlocutors as if he were the founding editor and owner. The themes of self-delusion and self-awareness are central, and Mabanckou invites us to ponder whether the narrator is peddling an alternative history, just as other customers of the bar seem to be. There comes a point when an unreliable narrator is so reliably unreliable that you can question whether he's really unreliable.Much of the writing from Africa (or at least most of the stuff we get to see) is of an earnest or grim character, and it makes a pleasant change to encounter a writer who isn't afraid of a laugh - even if his work is destined for the syllabuses of post-colonial literature courses. Tibor Fischer's latest novel is Good to Be God (Alma Books).TopicsFictionDuck SoupreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo's 1960s/70s crime series featuring the introspective, troubled Inspector Martin Beck inspired a generation of British crime-writers who then gave it right back. Beck partly begat John Harvey's Resnick, who helped beget Mankell's Wallender. Swedish author and journalist Stieg Larsson uses the tropes of both Scandinavian and British crime fiction but he is a one-off or, rather, was a one-off - tragically, he died of a heart attack, aged 50, in 2004.Tattoo is the first of his Millennium Trilogy to be published in the UK. It is a violent thriller that focuses on a complex financial fraud and a powerful family's sinister secret. It starts slowly, with details of how a Swedish company is ripping off government funding to set up a fake business in Russia. The novel picks up speed when it gets into the complexities of the wealthy Vanger family's past. Forty years earlier, Harriet Vanger disappeared off the family's private island. Nobody saw her leave, there was no sign of her disappearance and no corpse. Her uncle, however, is convinced that a family member murdered her.A journalist, Blomqvist, in disgrace after losing a libel case arising from his reporting of the financial scandal, takes on the investigation of the woman's disappearance. Almost immediately, he sees a link with a number of other murders taking place around the same time. The family only pretends to help and Blomqvist doesn't know where to go next.Then he hooks up with the titular tattooed girl - a very angry punk hacker. The journalist and the hacker are ingenious, believable creations, in conflict with themselves and each other. They form an incongruous but credible bond as everyone they meet is against them. In the end, the novel becomes, among many other things, something of a tender love story.Larsson's trilogy was published in Scandinavia and continental Europe to great acclaim between 2005 and 2007, after his death. Tattoo (Original title: Men Who Hate Women) won the prestigious Glass Key for the best Nordic crime novel of 2005. The Girl Who Played With Fire (2006) won a Swedish Academy for Detective Novels award. The third, Castles in the Sky, came out early last year.Larsson, a leading expert on right-wing extremists and neo-Nazi organisations, was editor of Expo, the magazine for a project he had set up to combat racism. He began writing the trilogy after work each evening in 2001. He claimed he enjoyed it so much that he was partway through the third before he even considered sending anything to a publisher.This is a striking novel, full of passion, an evocative sense of place and subtle insights into venal, corrupt minds. It's sad that a potentially great crime-writing career was ended almost before it began, but at least UK readers can enjoy this and look forward to the succeeding two novels in the trilogy.TopicsBooksThe ObserverFictionCrime fictionThrillersStieg LarssonreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Against the odds, after a bitter struggle with a fiendish opponent, he finally left the stage on cue. Now a decade of improbable wizardry is yielding to valedictory retrospectives. That's it, you might say: The End.JK Rowling's seven Harry Potter yarns are deeply of their time, and probably a mirror to it, as well as being a unique literary phenomenon of unprecedented global appeal. Rowling has performed this service to children's reading with spooky, even mindless, self-discipline. Time will tell if her efforts are timeless, or just a millennial fad.Whatever posterity's verdict, the record will show that they were popular from the first. Like many, I have followed their rise to global bestsellerdom with bemused fascination. The Observer did not review HP1 (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone), but there was sufficient buzz about HP2 (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) for it to sneak a diary mention, and for HP3 (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) to get a book review.By HP4 (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), the launch of the book had graduated to the status of a news event. Early one Saturday morning in July 2000 I found myself driving to Bloomsbury's offices to collect a heavily embargoed copy of HP4, and hurrying back to the office for a speed-read. Accordingly, The Observer announced 'the first Harry Potter review', a stunt to scoop our competitors. It was not a wildly enthusiastic notice, but it contained a verdict from which I do not resile: 'When the good fairy of fiction lays her magic wand on a newcomer she must bestow three blessings: in character, in story and in language. In Rowling's case, the good fairy was lavish in the first two benefactions, meagre in the third. Her prose is as flat and English as old beer.'None of that made a scrap of difference to the readers' response, which went from the obsessive to the delirious to the merely unhinged. Subsequently, when Bloomsbury switched its Potter launches to the witchier hour of midnight, I found myself reading into the small hours and filing urgent copy. Everyone was in on the game, and we had to keep up with the competition. In the mayhem of Pottermania, the sales soared higher and higher: 500,000, a million, five million ... Then came the films.Today, the statistics are off the charts: 325 million copies sold worldwide, translations in 63 languages (including Ancient Greek) and earnings that are said to make Rowling 'richer than the Queen'.On today's literary stock exchange, there's a bull market in Rowling shares, though it's safe to predict that eventually there will be a corrective reaction. Where her reputation will end up is anyone's guess. There's no doubt she will be read by juveniles of all ages for the foreseeable future. She remains formidable for her bestselling accomplishments, remarkable for her consistency, but vulnerable to the charge that she's not Pullman, not Tolkien and not CS Lewis.But she certainly understands the importance of plot, and exhibits narrative brio with a vigorous, if slightly predictable, imagination. Her prose will always lack magic, or charm. My 10-year-old has already moved on to richer reading, but while she was under Harry's spell, she was enchanted. Now just one question remains: is the end of Harry the end of JK Rowling? What will she do next? Do we care?TopicsChildren and teenagersThe ObserverHarry PotterJK RowlingIrelandEuropeReuse this contentWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now, with A Little Life, Yanagihara has reversed the proposition, telling the story of a boy who is chronically, outrageously abused by a series of adults tasked with his care, and his struggles to forget the nightmare of his childhood. This time everyone has taken note, including this year\u2019s Man Booker judges, who have selected it for their longlist.At first A Little Life reads like a male version of Mary McCarthy\u2019s The Group, as four university friends navigate the wider world. Malcolm, JB, Willem and Jude, randomly assigned as college roommates, become best friends. Bright, ambitious and talented, they all move to New York, pursuing different careers: handsome Willem works as a waiter while auditioning as an actor; JB creates trendily experimental art while dreaming of fame as a representational painter; Malcolm comes from a wealthy, demanding family and worries that his architecture career will not impress his father; Jude is a young lawyer, working for the public defender\u2019s office. The reader predicts that some will succeed, some will fail; some will build happy relationships, some won\u2019t; tragedies will strike and be overcome. The reader is quite mistaken, however: before long, all four friends are blessed with immoderate professional success, while two of them rapidly recede into the background, with Jude St Francis emerging as the novel\u2019s protagonist.This choice has several consequences, most of them infelicitous. It increasingly reduces other characters to plot functions or representative types, while transforming a refreshing take on friendship, loyalty and sympathy into a more customary chronicle of suffering and a survival that is hard-earned and always contingent. Jude closely guards his secrets, but 70 pages into this 700-page novel he reveals to Willem, his best friend and flatmate, that he habitually self-harms, while the reader learns that a brutal childhood is behind his cutting. Gradually Yanagihara discloses the extent, and specifics, of the abuse he suffered, while Jude\u2019s relationships with Willem and with the law professor, Harold, who becomes a surrogate father to him and legally adopts Jude at the age of 30, eventually claim the book\u2019s attention.As its focus on Jude intensifies, the novel stops being what made it unusual and begins to make great demands on our pity for him. His first 15 years consist of unrelieved, grotesque, extravagant abuse: and then an authorial switch is flipped. For the rest of his life (with the important exception of one disastrously abusive relationship), Jude encounters only selfless love and kindness: the patron saint of lost causes becomes a lost cause surrounded by saints. His friends are all very concerned with Jude, to the exclusion of being concerned about anyone else, including themselves. There is something unsettlingly infantile and narcissistic about this pre-Copernican conception of Jude\u2019s world, a fantasy construction in which the people who love him are as endlessly occupied by his psychodrama as he is. In real life, people tend to get tired of other people\u2019s repetition compulsions, largely because they are consumed by their own dramas. But this is a little life that tilts toward a large fairy tale, about cruelty and nobility, evil and goodness. Indeed, it is something of a triumph to make characters as relentlessly virtuous as Jude\u2019s friends seem even remotely believable, their affection for him as moving as it is. Willem\u2019s absolute goodness, in particular, functions only to throw into relief the desperation of Jude \u2013 and yet it is somehow touching, all the same.Equally implausible is the immense success of all four friends: Willem doesn\u2019t only make a living as an actor, he becomes a world-famous movie star. Malcolm is a globe-trotting, award-winning architect. JB is exhibited in MoMA before he is 30 \u2013 and his paintings are all of a major movie star, but no one in his audience seems distracted by that, or critical of the fact that he only paints the same three people. There are some sharp insights into the culture of New York, a place that operates \u201cas if happiness were something that everyone should and could attain, and that any sort of compromise in its pursuit was somehow your fault \u2026 only here did you feel compelled to somehow justify anything short of rabidity for your career; only here did you have to apologise for having faith in something other than yourself.\u201d It is not insignificant that this passage occurs early on; these characters live in a recognisably contemporary moment, with computers and emails, but history on a large scale does not happen to them. Nor do they ever outgrow each other \u2013 when they become distanced, it is intensely personal and deliberate, never situational or fortuitous. The only history that matters in this book is personal history.Early on, Jude remembers a kindly social worker who told him before he went to university: \u201cYou have to talk about these things while they\u2019re fresh. Or you\u2019ll never talk about them. It\u2019s going to get harder and harder the longer you wait, and it\u2019s going to fester inside you, and you\u2019re always going to think you\u2019re to blame.\u201d Jude certainly does think he\u2019s to blame, and Yanagihara never lets us forget it, imparting this salient fact many times over many pages. Jude\u2019s past has left him terrified of sex; and so, Yanagihara explains, \u201cin compensation for the sex, there is the cutting, which he has been doing more and more: to help ease the feelings of shame, and to rebuke himself for his feelings of resentment\u201d. These are the clinical notes of the therapist Jude refuses to see, rather than a glimpse of troubled interiority. The People in the Trees was told in the first person, bringing all the perspectival complexity of memory and disingenuousness and self-vindication. Here, Yanagihara chooses simply to inform us what her characters think. This is not thought: it is voiceover.The problem with telling rather than showing is not that it flouts an authorial precept set down by Henry James; writers are free to break all rules, including that one, if it improves their books. But such narration is distancing: it leaves us watching what Jude feels, rather than actively sharing in his confusion, pain, suffering. Meanwhile, eking out Jude\u2019s memories of elaborate tortures has the unfortunate effect of turning sadistic tales of child abuse into narrative payoff, while the ever more baroque punishments to which he is subjected begin to resemble martyrdom at the hands of an author, rather than the thoughtless brutalities of other human beings.And then Jude is saved \u2013 except that he isn\u2019t, which is the saving grace of a novel that remains gripping far beyond the point it has any right to be. There is something admirable in Yanagihara\u2019s refusal to let Jude overcome his past, her uncompromising insistence that it must gradually overcome him. This resistance to redemption is downright un-American, and all the better for it. Willem thinks at one point of his relationship with Jude: \u201cThey had chosen another, more familiar form of relationship, one that hadn\u2019t worked. But now they were inventing their own type of relationship, one that wasn\u2019t officially recognised by history or immortalised in poetry or song, but which felt truer and less constraining.\u201d The book does the reverse, beginning with something truer and less constraining, before reverting to the familiar.A Little Life is uneven, unusual, unrelenting; it moves swiftly forward before lurching into longueurs of anguish recounted, self-hatred chronicled. \u201cAn elegant mind wants elegant endings,\u201d Jude says at one point, eulogising a maths professor who believed in the axiom of equality. Elegant minds probably prefer elegant patterns throughout, and not only at the end. Like its protagonist, this is a novel discomposed by searching questions. But it also shows the truth of a maxim Edmund Wilson once proposed, that a novel can commit any number of sins so long as it does not commit the cardinal one \u2013 it must not fail to live. Somehow, against all the odds, just like its protagonist, this book survives everything its author throws at it \u2013 and if it doesn\u2019t quite triumph, it has far outplayed the odds.

Totally focused on every word, and the book sang out to me like the radio.\" Thus Bob Dylan, 45 years after the event, recalls a formative moment in modern popular music: his first encounter with Bound for Glory , the autobiography of Woody Guthrie. In structure and style, Dylan's memoir recalls Guthrie's, but its mood and preoccupations are different. Instead of the open skies and sharp outlines of Bound for Glory, Chronicles is full of smoky, jumbled interiors. Where the master's book was rumbustious, optimistic, teeming, the disciple's is ruminative, sometimes puzzled, and in the end painfully lonely. And where Bound for Glory offered the uplifting tale of Guthrie's discovery of his vocation as a people's singer, Chronicles traces a more equivocal journey, one involving loss as well as discovery. The bulk of the book is a captivating evocation of Dylan's first year in New York city (1961), with flashbacks to his boyhood in Minnesota. Here he draws a touching portrait of himself as an ambitious young artist, trembling on the brink of self-realisation. In the middle, there are less enjoyable but revealing excursions into two later junctures in the singer's career, studies in alienation, frustration and compromise. What's not in the book could fill tomes (and already has). There's nothing about singing at the 1963 march on Washington or going electric at Newport in 1965 or the \"Judas!\" heckle in Manchester in 1966. Nothing about drugs or sex. Nothing about the fundamentalist Christian phase or about his Jewishness. None the less, in the course of his meandering narrative, Dylan touches on a fascinating variety of topics - personal, musical, historical. New York at the dawn of the 60s is recreated with warmth and detail. This is the flickering urban landscape of \"Visions of Johanna\", peopled with \"all kinds of characters looking for the inner heat\", mingling in cluttered, carefully observed Greenwich Village apartments. In Dylan's memory New York is \"cold, muffled, mysterious\", a city of epiphanies: \"I passed a horsedrawn wagon full of covered flowers, all under a plastic wrap, no driver in sight. The city was full of stuff like that.\" Chronicles is peppered with vivid sketches of the stars of New York's folk demimonde: Fred Neill, Cisco Houston, Len Chandler, Paul Clayton (whose suicide a few years later Dylan does not mention), the blues guitarist and Marxist intellectual Dave Van Ronk (\"no puppet strings on him ever\"). John Hammond, the veteran leftwinger who produced Dylan's first albums, is recalled with awe: \"There were maybe a thousand kings in the world and he was one of them.\" The prose is a Dylanesque blend of luminous specifics and myopic vagueness. It's unpruned, sometimes repetitious. There are malapropisms and clich\u00e9s. But the lapses and rough edges are part of the Dylan package. Among the book's pleasures are brief, acute appreciations of, among others, Roy Orbison, Ricky Nelson, Harry Belafonte, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, \"the bittersweet, lonely, intense world of Harold Arlen\", composer of \"the cosmic 'Somewhere over the Rainbow'\". There are also intriguing, off-the-wall observations about figures ranging from Clausewitz and Thucydides to Joe Hill and Balzac (\"He wears a monk's robe and drinks endless cups of coffee... one of his teeth falls out, and he says, 'What does this mean?'\"), plus a tip of the hat to the flamboyant professional wrestler Gorgeous George, who was also an influence on Muhammad Ali. The Dylan of these chapters is a true believer in the religion of folk, which \"exceeded all human understanding, and if it called out to you, you could disappear and be sucked into it.\" He claims that the old songs taught him there was nothing new on this earth. History was cyclical: societies emerge, flourish, decline (but \"I had no idea which of these stages America was in\"). Here he seems to be reading back into his youth some of the attitudes he struck later on. The young man who wrote \"Hattie Carroll\", \"With God on Our Side\", \"Masters of War\" and \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" was a poet of urgency, and he would have found the fatalism of the later Dylan far too pat. \"I had a primitive way of looking at things and I liked country fair politics,\" he insists. \"My favourite politician was [rightwing] Arizona senator Barry Goldwater, who reminded me of Tom Mix.\" Maybe, but this \"primitive\" also dissected the political psychology of the fallout-shelter craze in \"Let Me Die in My Footsteps\", lambasted anti-communist hysteria in \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\", and explored the link between race and class in \"Only a Pawn in Their Game\". At first glance the chapters in the middle of the book appear to concern the making of New Morning (1970) and Oh Mercy (1989). One's heart sinks. Why not Highway 61 or Blonde on Blonde or Blood on the Tracks or even Love and Theft ? Yet there's a surprise hidden in these chapters, for they tell stories most artists avoid telling, stories of unresolved crisis. Of failure. The New Morning chapter is framed by Dylan's stiff encounter with the elderly poet Archibald MacLeish, who wants him to compose songs for a play he's written. Dylan respects the poet but cannot communicate with him. Indeed, he seems to have lost the ability to communicate with anyone. Since those sweet, vanished days in Greenwich Village, his life had been transformed. He was not only wildly famous; he was famous as \"the voice of a generation\", and he hated it. Retiring to rural Woodstock, he finds \"moochers showing up from as far away as California on pilgrimages... rogue radicals looking for the prince of protest\". People \"would stare at me when they saw me, like they'd stare at a shrunken head or a giant jungle rat\". He's shocked at an Esquire cover featuring a monster with four faces: JFK, Malcolm X, Castro - and himself. \"What the hell was that supposed to mean?\" He can no longer function as an artist. Creativity requires \"observation\" and \"it was impossible now for me to observe anything without being observed\". The half-finished tunes he started for MacLeish end up on New Morning but Dylan remains ambivalent about their value. They aren't the kind of songs \"where you hear an awful roaring in your head\". The Oh Mercy chapter explores a career crisis of the late 80s and includes several pages of musicological flummery about \"a style of playing based on an odd instead of even numbered system\". This wary-eyed, seen-it-all sceptic has a history of falling for cranky notions, but the claim that the new system enables him to sing endlessly without \"fatigue\" or \"emotion\" makes one suspect an old-style Dylan put-on. For all its unaffected frankness, Chronicles has its share of feints and dodges, and it wouldn't be Dylan's otherwise. The Dylan of the middle chapters is spectral, even to himself. And this is immediately apparent when one returns, in the final chapter, to the heady early days in New York. Here he provides a step-by-step account of the influences that led him to his ferocious synthesis of tradition and individuality. First, there's Guthrie, whose songs had \"the infinite sweep of humanity in them\". Then there's Brecht and Weill's Pirate Jenny: \"a wild song... a nasty song ... there was no love for people in it.\" Then Robert Johnson: \"The stabbing sounds from the guitar could almost break a window.\" Wrap it all up with Rimbaud and a beautiful leftwing girlfriend, and \"I was sitting at the gateway\". Chronicles ends with Dylan on the verge of his breakthrough. But this breakthrough will also - we know from the intervening chapters - be a tragic rupture. The pathos of Dylan is that his self was ripped from his grasp at a time when he had barely begun to know it. It's clear that these wounds still smart, that Dylan still reels from the trauma, and that the memory of those early months in New York, those months of discovery, remains precious. \"The folk music scene had been like a paradise that I had to leave.\" Perhaps I'm swayed by the fact that this book is so much better than I feared it might be (as a fan since the 60s, I've got used to disappointments). But with this rich, intermittently preposterous, often tender work, Bob Dylan has delivered more than many of us dared hope for. \u00b7 Mike Marqusee's most recent book is Chimes of Freedom: The Politics of Bob Dylan's Art (The New Press).TopicsBooksHigher educationBiography booksBob DylanMusic booksreviewsReuse this contentEducationSchoolsTeachersUniversitiesStudentsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

More than just a bumper book of boffins behaving badly; encompassing four centuries and several disciplines, Rivals sketches an alternative history of science - one where advances occur not through the patient, dispassionate, collegial pursuit of truth taught in textbooks, but as a result of feuds between monster egos, involving lies, theft and skulduggery.TopicsBooksHigher educationReuse this contentEducationSchoolsTeachersUniversitiesStudentsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Not the story (though he does that, too), but the book itself, possessing the characters at inconvenient moments, forcing broken language out of their mouths and scattering it across the page, \"ducking and diving between the words ... deceiving and then disappearing\". For jesters, like clowns, are not actually about comedy, are they? They're about mischief, and malevolent mischief at that.And so, in a way, is Nicola Barker. Through six novels and two short-story collections, she has made a virtue of dangerous play. She is a serious writer, certainly, maybe even a \"serious\" one, but it is difficult to think of another contemporary novelist who will so relentlessly pursue the truth and then punctuate it with a honking red nose, who will expose real pain and human complexity while at the same time squirting water in your eye. Each of her works brims with electricity, energy and invention, with rude humour, originality and contrariness. She is not to everyone's taste, but isn't that good reason to cherish her all the more?Who else but Barker would produce an 838-page epic with little describable plot, taking place over just a few days and set in - wait for it - Ashford? For that's what Darkmans is, and it is phenomenally good.The novel opens simply, with a meeting in a caf\u00e9 between father and son. Beede is the father, a lifelong Ashford resident whose victory against the Channel Tunnel's destruction of a local landmark took a Pyrrhic turn and left him a small, embittered old man working in a hospital laundry. According to his son Kane, Beede celebrates a kind \"immaculate dullness - he was the Virgin Mary of the long hour\". And yet no one is ever that simple, especially in a Barker novel. For Beede's life has been ruined (for complicated reasons) by the theft of some antique tiles, and he has embarked on a mysterious project with the forger Peta Borough (an electric hand buzzer of a name) that seems to involve strange duplications and research into John Scogin, jester in the court of Edward IV.Kane, meanwhile, \"easy as a greased nipple (and pretty much as moral)\", deals prescription drugs, supplied by a hospital work colleague of Beede's. Kane's mother divorced Beede when he was young and then died after a long illness. After her death, Kane decided to style himself as the anti-Beede, and communication between the two has broken down so badly that not only is the meeting in the caf\u00e9 accidental and surprising to both men, but neither will relent and tell the other what he's doing there.Beede, it seems, is awaiting the arrival of Elen, a pretty chiropodist with mysterious bruises. Contrary to his dull persona, Beede has stolen some of Kane's drug stash, but are they for Elen or for her German husband Dory? Dory seems to suffer from a mental illness somewhere between narcolepsy and schizophrenia. In a daze and on horseback, he arrives at the same caf\u00e9 as everyone else. Beede, ever steadfast, calms Dory down and leads him home, though Dory, who remembers nothing about stealing the horse, is growing more suspicious of both Beede's and Elen's motives.Kane, meanwhile, returns home to find his ex-girlfriend, the endlessly profane teenager Kelly, waiting on his doorstep with a freshly broken leg, having fallen off a wall. Kelly is a member of the Broad family, a long line of thieves, chavs and drugheads who have spent most of their time making life miserable for the other residents of Ashford. She is being aided by Gaffar, a Kurdish repairman who, after a fight with Kane over the seriousness of Kelly's injuries, comes to work for him as a courier and also befriends Beede who, of course, shares a house with the son he barely talks to.Then there is the matter of Fleet, son of Elen and Dory, an eerily gifted and strangely prescient boy who has building a painstaking model of the Cathedral of Saint-Cecile with matchsticks. To the growing alarm of Elen and Dory (and Kane, who involves himself with Elen simply because Beede has told him not to), Fleet knows impossible amounts of information about the same John Scogin that Beede is researching. And during Dory's hazy episodes, Fleet calls his father \"John\".Which brings us back to the jester who haunts the book. The word \"darkmans\" is old thief cant for nighttime. But Barker, as ever, is far more interested in the flexibility of language than in simple, straightforward definitions. Darkmans in this novel is the night, yes, but it's also the weight of history pressing down on the present, sometimes suffocating it. Darkmans is also the dark man, Scogin himself, inhabiting the characters, driving them to acts of cruelty and comic destruction. Beede finds his back hunching and his feet literally curling. Dory unwittingly recreates some of Scogin's most notorious and disastrous pranks. And Kane sees visions of fire and speaks in words he's never heard before. History here is a joker, a malicious one happy to see you suffer. \"John always comes back,\" Fleet says. \"That's the whole point.\"Because what is history but the story we tell ourselves about ourselves, the language that connects us to each other and to our pasts? But Barker's argument is more interesting than even that, for every time she suggests a larger scheme, she punctures the idea with a cutting remark until finally, in the last few pages, Peta seems to sum up this entire wonderful contrary sprawl of a novel by talking about the \"absurd idea that language has these gaps in it and that lives can somehow just tumble through\". When Kane points out that this \"absurd idea\" was Peta's own, she replies: \"Nah. I probably just said what I needed to, so we'd both end up here.\"So is ending up \"here\" worth all this length? Absolutely. Over all these hundreds of pages, Barker's linguistic energy never lets up. Not everything works equally well - a section on Kelly's cowboy builder uncle feels too familiar - but there are no doldrums, no loitering anywhere. Importantly, too, this is not a messy novel, despite its ostensibly freewheeling nature. It has been constructed very carefully, with artful clues and playful games, and though you may have to dig to unravel the full implications of the ending, the effort is worth it.It is also very, very funny. Kelly's monstrous mother is \"Jabba the Hut with a womb, chronic asthma and a council flat\". Kelly herself protests to Gaffar that she's never done drugs, \"apart from the odd bit of puff an' speed an' E, obviously\". And Kane informs us, quite casually, \"one irreducible fact is that people who climb mountains are invariably cunts\".Barker comes up with a particularly good device for Gaffar, who speaks broken English in the same font as the rest of the characters but switches to a baroque typeface when speaking highly eloquent Turkish, often in the course of a single sentence. Aside from almost backhandedly making a sharp point about the perception of immigrants and language, Gaffar is allowed hugely important monologues in which the only word the other characters can understand is \"Thermos\".Most of all, Darkmans is a novel about language. Whatever its ability to connect human beings, whatever its false or true suggestions of real communication, language is un-containable. \"Like a fast-running river. It bubbles up and splashes and spills.\" It is \"sometimes more of a ... a roar, and sometimes just a titter. Sometimes a yuk-yuk-yuk or a hoarse guffaw or a tee-hee-hee, or a single, sharp Ha! (It [is] nothing if not variable).\"Darkmans is just the sort of bravura performance that will probably inspire vitriol in a certain breed of reviewer as too ostentatious, too brazen. Pity them, reader, for being unable to embrace such a loud shout of glorious, untidy, angry, joyous life. Barker is a great, restless novelist, and Darkmans is a great, restless novel. At the end of 838 blinding, high-octane pages, I was bereft that there weren't 838 more. \u00b7 Patrick Ness's most recent book is Topics About Which I Know Nothing (Harper Perennial)TopicsBooksFictionNicola BarkerPatrick NessreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The publisher's blurb for Helen Dunmore's seventh novel, set in Leningrad in 1941 during the first year of the German blockade, made me immediately question her taste. A city that Hitler intended to starve into submission is hardly the place for Anna and Andrei, a 20th-century Pierre and Natasha, to fall into passionate embraces. In fact, Dunmore's ambitions are not as broad as Tolstoy's in either historical scope or emotional intensity. The Siege , with its tight domestic focus, is resolutely no War and Peace (nor, thankfully, no romantic melodrama). Like all Dunmore's fiction, it is delicately evocative and immensely readable; yet, after polishing it off in three or four enjoyable sittings, I still found it in some primary way indigestible. We first come across Anna Levin, a Leningrad nursery-school assistant and the novel's central character, one June evening. She is at the family dacha, planting potatoes, onions and cabbage. With a poet's economy, Dunmore sketches in not only the death of Anna's mother and her maternal duties to her small brother Kolya, but also the political culture of Stalin's Soviet Union. Before Anna has so much as sown the radishes, we also know that her father Mikhail, a writer, has fallen foul of the Writer's Union, and that Anna's own ideological mettle is considered suspect by the rigidly orthodox head of her nursery. If Dunmore's slight references touch off historical sparks, then the reason for her brevity is immediately apparent. As Anna sets off to visit an old flame of her father's, Marina Petrovna - an actress now living out in the country to escape further denunciation from the authorities - we know that by the time she returns, this image of tranquillity will be shattered. This is no ordinary June evening; it is the eve of Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union. Anna won't be going back to harvest her vegetable plot. Historical events aside, readers familiar with Dunmore's fiction will detect other inevitabilities. Here is a family unit, not four-square but pulled into an awkward rectangle by the absence of a mother, the nurturing role thrust upon Anna, and the introduction of Marina Petrovna. This probing of relationships gives a much-needed dimension independent of the brutal facts of the family's survival. Anna, a talented but untrained artist, has been summoned to sketch Marina. As she puts pencil to paper, she is forced to look hard at the woman who disturbed her childhood. And when Marina moves into the Levins' Leningrad apartment that autumn, Anna comes to understand the complexity of adult relationships. Dunmore has used such unconventional arrangements before to track the dynamics of familial love. This young, intelligent but untested heroine, half-hidden behind her sketchpad, recalls the young girl at the centre of Dunmore's debut, Zennor in Darkness , who observes, and also sketches, D H Lawrence and his German lover, Frieda, sitting out the first world war in a Cornish cottage. In many ways, the material facts of the Leningrad blockade complement Dunmore's style of writing: the emotional trajectories of her characters fall neatly within her narrative of the first year of the siege. Anna, back from the dacha, is sent to dig tank traps on the outskirts of the city. In her work battalion she is sandwiched between Evgenia - an earthy worker, cynical enough about the power of the party high-ups but sensible about whom she shares her remarks with - and Katya, a dreamy child of the intelligentsia whose hands will never toughen up. Anna is the bridge between the two, accepting Evgenia's rough humour and her advice, but still able to sympathise with Katya's daydreams of dresses and walks along Nevsky Prospect. Meanwhile, Mikhail is sent to the front in a barely equipped People's Volunteers unit. There he meets Andrei, a medical student. Mikhail begins his siege journal, allowing Dunmore to offload the military background to the war, while Andrei, who treats the wounded and later the malnourished, provides the medical dimension. More importantly, a relationship develops between Andrei and Anna. Here Dunmore treads carefully and cleverly. On their second meeting, Dunmore shows Anna washing herself with the last sliver of Marina's jasmine soap, but the contours of their growing romance are not to be traced in perfume. As the winter cold bites and the bread ration is cut, Andrei explains the effects of hunger on the body's responses. Anna can offer Andrei only hot-water \"tea\", and when they share a bed it is a practical gesture: the two huddle close, with Kolya between them, to keep warm and to stay alive. As the German noose pulls tighter, the Levins' world gradually closes in until it is concentrated on their apartment, the contents of the store cupboard, the stove, and Anna's dangerous forays to collect their bread ration or to forage for wood among the city's bombed-out buildings. Dunmore is at ease when her focus is forced ever more sharply on the domestic interior. She has always written superbly about food, the mundanities of its preparation and its emotional role, and in The Siege it is, naturally, the vital centre of the narrative. Anna does return to the dacha to harvest her vegetables, creeping out into the no man's land between the Soviet and German frontline. Unable to fit much on her bicycle, she tramps down the rest so that the German army cannot eat her crops. When Marina and Anna boil up a pigskin manicure case with the wallpaper paste from Kolya's toy fort to make \"soup\", the reader is pulled back to the homemade jam Marina offers Anna on their first meeting, and the trout Mikhail and Kolya cook on her return. Their hunger gives Anna and Marina's dreamy backward-looking reflections an almost physical plausibility. However, the content of their reflections and histories have, on occasion, too familiar a ring. Anna's complaints about the \"double burden\" of her job and domestic responsibilities - the litany of the trudge from house, to work, to food queue and home - comes from Natalya Baranskaya's A Week Like Any Other . Lydia Ginzburg's Notes of a Blockade Survivor are also apparent, while Nadezhda Mandelstam's memoirs give Marina and Mikhail, archetypal members of the post-revolution intelligentsia, their depth. Dunmore freely acknowledges her sources, and any writer, Russian or not, would be foolish to ignore such rich wells of material on Stalin's Russia. But for anyone reasonably familiar with the period, the bones sometimes protrude too sharply. The same is true of Dunmore's Leningrad: a quote from the opening stanza of Pushkin's \"Bronze Horseman\" is inevitable. The motif of an unnatural city that stands on the bones of its builders is as expected as Paris in the spring. Dunmore may be following a literary tradition of personifying the city begun by Pushkin, but she imitates rather than develops the theme. This sense that Dunmore has borrowed rather than truly inhab ited the history that The Siege makes use of is never really dispersed. Her characters' inner lives and relationships have undoubted emotional truth, but when they have to interact with real places and events, they fall into expected patterns. We know what Anna will have to do to survive, what deprivations she will endure, because we have read the same histories as Dunmore. We also know from the guidebooks and the memoirs how she will respond to her native city and to the political culture she lives in. Leningrad/St Petersburg's rich and often horrific 20th century offers tempting material for any novelist, and the blockade is undoubtedly one of its darkest periods.

The truth we mean when we call it \"stranger than fiction\" is waste land, full of random clutter, arbitrary. And actually, with some effort, you probably could make it up. It would be pointless, that's all, just adding to the chaos.But books, and especially the created abstractions that are novels, fold our base realities. They uplift, press and pleat the plane of existence, packing and unpacking all our plans and works, all our cases and designs. The buildings rise, profiles plotting complexity, with every library a peak upon that graph, a virtual spike of processed information. Suddenly there is something there to understand that we have ourselves emplaced. Objects demand, and reward, closer inspection.The library reveals itself to be fractal as we zoom in, growing peaks and valleys, crests and troughs, within the crumpled scape of information. And just occasionally, out of that general, gently rolling vista, an individual work jumps out at us, a spike within the spike, a spired city dominating the surrounding towns, villages and hamlets and denoting where a writer has upped the game and achieved a critical density of meaning that sends the needles of our discriminatory apparata off the scale.So we are brought to Light. Harrison's latest work marks a return to a genre - unashamed science fiction, indeed space fiction - that many of us thought he'd abandoned for ever, after The Centauri Device, nearly 30 years ago.Recent novels of spare textual elegance and closure-denying restraint - Climbers, The Course of the Heart and Signs of Life - have impressed and fulfilled, but also implied that if he chose to Harrison could storm back over the barricades and into the SF ghetto with even more skill and energy than when he left. Harrison has developed enormously, bringing a far deeper wisdom and considerably more mature literary ability to the task of showing a generation or two of SF writers inspired by his earlier work how it should be done.The novel unfolds in three strands. In one, we meet Seria Mau Genlicher, the barely embodied captain of a K-ship called the White Cat. \"Night and day,\" we are told, K-ships \"crouched in the service bays with arc lights slicking down their dark grey flanks. They were restless. They flickered in and out of visibility as their navigation systems trawled through 10 spatial dimensions. They never disconnected their defences or target-acquisition systems, so the air around them was constantly cooking with everything from gamma to microwaves. Work near them, you wore a lead suit.\"Seria Mau prowls the fretful shoals of lights off the Kefahuchi Tract, arguing with her ship's shadow operators, existing at the admittedly tender mercy of the vessel's mathematics, all the while grumpily bamboozled by a package from Uncle Zip asking her for something she can't understand.The Kefahuchi Tract is a naked singularity, an affront to physical laws hanging in the sky, an ultimate attractor for civilisations over geological ages of time. It is surrounded by the halo of lights and it is all... biggish, shall we say. Most easily graspable in bits.The Tract \"streams across half the sky, trailing its vast invisible plumes of dark matter\". On its ragged margins is the Beach, where \"the corroded old prehuman observatories wove their chaotic orbits, tool platforms and laboratories abandoned millions of years previously by entities who had no idea where they were - or perhaps anymore what they were. They had all wanted a closer look at the Tract. Some of them had steered whole planets into position, then wandered off.\"There you find \"burnt-out stuff, litter from the galaxy's early evolution. Young suns are at a premium, but you can find them\". Galactic beachcombers \"went out one morning with their lives all washed up and returned in the evening corporate CEOs heavy with patents... But the real secrets, the long secrets, were in the Tract if they were anywhere, and no one had ever returned from there.\"Michael Kearney, Harrison's second protagonist, is a fore-haunted, dissolute, very soft-working scientist from here and about now, living in a world of Lego, Sony camcorders, Lancia Integrales and Buffy re-runs, a man who as a child was both shattered and crushed when he glimpsed reality's hidden heart on another beach. \"[S]ome shift of vision had altered his perspective; he saw clearly that the gaps between the larger stones made the same sorts of shapes as the gaps between the smaller ones. The more he looked, the more the arrangement repeated itself. Suddenly he understood this as a condition of things... there it would be, a boiling, inexplicable, vertiginous similarity in all the processes of the world, roaring silently away from you in ever-shifting repetitions, always the same, never the same thing twice. In that moment he was lost.\"The third strand of the narrative features Ed Chianese, a \"twink\" living a dream life of Chandlerian pastiche in a virtual-reality tank as Chinese Ed, wise-cracking private eye, a hard man with a soft spot for swell broads. Tig Vesicle, a shock-haired \"New Man\", runs the tank farm; then runs with Ed after a bloody rumble courtesy of the grisly Cray Sisters and their squad of bermachoid henchlings: \" 'Hey,' he said. 'What planet am I on?' Vesicle stared at him. 'Come on,' Ed said. 'Be fair. Anyone can have a problem with that'.\"And so on, off the scale. The rest is story, and it is Harrison's job - and, you suspect, joy - to unfold, not mine.The ride is uproarious, breath-taking, exhilarating. Sentences flitter and flare into prominences, sudden foci of meaning in the drifts of sparely elegant prose: \"She had the impatience of a 14-year-old - that life had not allowed her to remain 14, she could sometimes imply, was her special tragedy.\" Gem-like images blink into existence, perfect in their place, both wise and sly.Harrison buzz words appear, which those who have been with him from the days of \"The Lamia and Lord Cromis\" have come to recognise: actinic, deracinating, stridulating... Much is made of binary cats, of feelings of exhaustion, of sex, memory and loss.Oceanic imagery abounds, and to an even greater extent the book is redolent of the shore, continually speaking of the battered frayedness of lives lived on and affected by disputed margins, jostled between vast elemental forces forever in contention.The temporary inhabitants of these uneasy regions seem never fully committed either to where they are or to whatever it might be that they are about to launch themselves out into; and it is in this zone that the characters find \"the coiled swell of empty space that sucks into itself one significant event of your life after another and if you don't move on you're left there gazing out across nothing at nothing much again\". The shore we are really on, and the nature of our emplacement there, the design behind the wash of information, becomes clear only at the end.Criticisms? Well, those looking for sympathetic major characters have a limited choice. Seria Mau Genlicher opens her account with an act of piratical mass murder; Michael Kearney is merely a serial killer, though of course closer to home. The names are mostly rollingly satisfying, sometimes jokey. A street junction is described as where Impreza meets Skyline, so Harrison knows fast cars, while Polo Sport and Anais Anais are (presumably fragrant) planets. The Kefahuchi Tract, however, sounds a little like John Varley's Ophiuchi Hotline, while Tig Vesicle will try the patience of some and Billy Anker - uh-huh - most that get it, you'd imagine. But that's about it for this reporter.At the novel's end - and it does achieve a suitably transformational, connection-rich conclusion, rather than simply stopping - we are left with impressions of utter clarity, extravagant invention and bewildering energy, plus the disquieting feeling that we might actually have understood something of the way things really work.This is a novel of full-spectrum literary dominance, making the transition from the grainily commonplace now to a wild far future seem not just easy but natural, and connecting the minimal and the spectacular with grace and elegance. It is a work of - and about - the highest order.\u00b7 Iain Banks's most recent novels are Dead Air (Little, Brown) and, as Iain M Banks, Look to Windward (Orbit)TopicsBooksIain BanksScience fiction booksreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The ongoing story of literature in foreign languages is barely noticed, a background pixel in the all-important anglophone display.Indie UK publisher Portobello has issued all three novels by Jenny Erpenbeck, a multi-prizewinning German who is one of the finest, most exciting authors alive. In our island, she's just another obscure outlander whose work attracts almost no reviews and certainly no media fanfare. This autumn, an extravagantly hyped American novel examining in exhaustive detail how the middle classes there currently feel about themselves will be bought by a great many Britons who'll strive to understand every local nuance. But Erpenbeck? East Germany? Who cares? How I wish that Visitation could change all that. How I hope that some room may be found to celebrate this author's uncanny gifts.Erpenbeck's reputation was made by her 1999 debut, The Old Child, one of the best first novels ever written. Next came The Book Of Words, surreal and dreamlike but no less potent. Each of these pocket-sized novellas was about a young girl, yet also functioned as an enigmatic allegory of a country with dark secrets. In Visitation, allegory is toned down, history intrudes more explicitly, and the narrative canvas is bigger. The page count may still be modest, but the achievement and resonance are massive.Visitation's central character is a place. In a grand house and its grounds, by a lake in Brandenburg, a succession of occupants dislodge each other, borne along by the political calamities of 20th century Europe. The Jewish family who own the property in the 1930s are forced to sell while they wait for visas out of the Third Reich. An architect renovates the house; at the end of the second world war, it's requisitioned by the Russian army; then, under the GDR, the architect has to flee for having done illegal business with the west. The place is reclaimed by returning exiles from Siberia, then resold by estate agents.The set-up is strikingly similar to Simon Mawer's Booker-shortlisted The Glass Room, published only last year, although Erpenbeck's novel appeared in Germany in 2008. The handling could hardly be more different, with Erpenbeck's prose eschewing the conventional tactics, neatly sewn-up psychologies and film-friendly dialogue that characterised Mawer's work. Visitation is foreign in the profoundest sense of that word. We are shown no dramatic meetings, no fraught conversations, between the architect and the Jews he supplants; we only see him taking a swim and wiping himself dry with one of the towels that are still hanging in the bathing-house \"before it could occur to his wife to wash them\". He congratulates himself for having given the Jews the full half market-value set by the law, and for helping them escape persecution. \"Strange towels,\" he reflects. \"Cloth manufacturers, these Jews. Terrycloth. Top quality goods.\"Quotes like this, while they hint at the troubling finesse of Erpenbeck's touch, don't do justice to the true subtlety of her fiction. It's common for literary authors to give objectionable characters a veneer of decency for us to see through; that's not what Erpenbeck is aiming for. She immerses us so deeply in the worldview of each protagonist that we grow fond of them all, worry about the things that worry them, cease to see the things that they ignore. We want them all to hold on to their home.The one person known to all the owners and occupants \u2013 and thus the thread that binds the narrative together \u2013 is the gardener. Periodic updates are given of his activities, describing his routines in detail. The first few times, the repetitious litany of watering, pruning, composting, etc, seems unnecessary, but as the decades pass and the property gets eaten away by misuse and decay, the gardener's patient, pragmatic labours become unexpectedly moving. No word is ever heard from him, and Erpenbeck allows no access to his mind, but we end up feeling great relief whenever he reappears, and deep sadness as this increasingly frail figure does what he can to forestall his Eden's incremental slide into ruin.Indeed, the amount of emotional engagement Erpenbeck manages to win from us, in a mere 150 pages, is just one proof of her mastery. In marked contrast to the unearned love that inflated novels so often demand, Visitation allows us to feel we've known real individuals, experienced the slow unfolding of history, and bonded unconditionally with a place, without authorial pestering or pathos-cranking.Impressive as it is, Visitation lacks the jewel-like perfection of The Old Child. Its richly populated, realistic narrative poses a big challenge for an author previously hailed as a miniaturist, and Erpenbeck is tempted by different methods of tackling it. The introduction, describing the prehistoric forces that formed the landscape on which the house will stand, may strike some as pretentious. The chapter devoted to the first tenant and his four daughters, in the Weimar period, is part fable, part poetry, part database of superstitious custom, stylistically harking back to The Book of Words. Even once Erpenbeck has settled into the book's distinctive form, the concept of the Brandenburg estate as the narrative's picture-frame is not consistently adhered to: a chapter covering the fate of Doris, one of the exiled Jews, shifts the action to an abandoned house in the Warsaw ghetto. (A forgivable diversion. This 11-page episode, set mostly inside a pitch-dark closet, is one of the most powerful distillations of the Holocaust I've ever encountered in fiction: it deserves to be widely anthologised as a classic short story.)Translator Susan Bernofsky, who did a superb job on the previous books, is back for this one. Erpenbeck's German is poetical, almost incantatory, taking full advantage of the portmanteau words and Rubik's cube grammar of that language. Bernofsky opts for a smooth style that won't come across as bizarre in English, sacrificing some of Erpenbeck's verse-like cadences and delivering a flexible, accessible narrative. Typical of her shrewdness is the title, Visitation, which at first glance seems a dryly prosaic alternative to Erpenbeck's original Heimsuchung (\"homeseeking\") but reveals its appositeness as the story unfolds: not only is there a literal visitation when a wife is granted access to her imprisoned husband, but the displaced residents of the house become increasingly like unwelcome ghosts haunting the locus of their lost lives.So, there you have it: an extraordinarily strong book by a major German author, ingeniously translated, produced with love by an idealistic publisher intent on doing something about the shamefully small proportion of foreign literature whose existence our country acknowledges. Will Visitation find a home here? Or will the Anglo incumbents claim all the lebensraum?Michel Faber's The Fire Gospel is published by Canongate.TopicsFictionreviewsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Nothing else I have read, save Carolyn Steedman's Landscape for a Good Woman, destroys so successfully the fantasy of the family as a safe place to be or describes so well the way in which rage, grief and frustrated desire are passed down the family line like a curse, leaving offspring to live out the inherited, unresolved lives of their forebears. In a sense this is what autobiography is about: the ways in which your own story is not really yours at all, but a version of the tale of your parents or grandparents. These are the ways in which you become, as Steedman puts it, \"not quite yourself, but someone else\", and this is what makes it such a dissatisfying genre for those wanting a reassuring or comfortable description of the growth of an individual mind. The best memoirs can make for some curious narratives, and they can be least successful where they are most searching. In Henry James's childhood memoir, A Small Boy and Others, he omits himself altogether. It becomes apparent that this is what his experience of childhood actually was - a process not of developing out of his family but of absorbing himself back into it, living through them by means of what he later called \"shared consciousness\". Bad Blood is also a tale of shared consciousness, and although the lives Sage describes clash with and limit her own, there is much that is redemptive here, and even elegiac. Tales of disappointment form the bedrock of Lorna Sage's story. Her embittered grandmother, 4ft 10 and round as a barrel, longed for her hometown of Tonypandy, where she had some class as the daughter of a shopkeeper. She was consumed by an apoplectic hatred of all men, particularly her husband, whom she blackmailed from the other side of the house. Sage's mother swiftly retreated from the \"violently unhappy\" marriage of her parents into the \"magical world of unreality\", assuming a fey impracticality far from the model of the super-efficient 1950s housewife. The \"fierce monogamy\" of Sage's parents took on a violence of its own: their intimacy allowed no one in and made orphans of their two children. Her father, a distant figure, happiest during the war when he had a role and a mission, later gallantly protected his spouse from the passions of her family - and particularly those of Lorna, fiery and bookish and thus an inheritor of Grandpa's bad blood. It is Sage's Byronic grandfather, the local vicar, who provides the centre of the story, and around whom Sage forges her identity. Cursing a marriage that has neither love, understanding nor imagination, he turns to a life of unabashed wickedness. Indulging in lust and drink, he becomes for his granddaughter a \"defiant and grandly outrageous\" figure in his self-defeating recklessness, a Gothic outsider with all \"the glamour of the undead\". In Sage's celebration - or invention - of the glamorous alter ego beneath her grandfather's desperately limited life, Bad Blood is at its most gripping, and its most moving touch is her tribute to his thwarted ambition and ridiculed desires. Finding an old pocket diary for 1934 and decoding the banal secret life it records -\"It was the diary of a nobody\" - she quotes his hurt at being \"taunted\" by his teenage lover, a friend of his daughter, for resolving to escape the philistine values of the parish and the vicarage and to start a new life as a writer. \"That freelance existence never materialised for him,\" his grand-daughter writes; \"here are his words, though, in print at last.\" The vicar of Hanmer is redeemed from the \"squalor of insignificance\" he fought against. The heir of his bad blood has rewritten his story, giving to its grim drudgery the grandeur and dignity of a Greek tragedy.\nA central theme in Bad Blood is places and spaces, and how we learn to shape ourselves around them. Hanmer, on the borders of Wales and England and where Sage spends the first part of her childhood, becomes a metaphor for the suffocation of living \"in-between\": between the second world war and the 1960s, between the covers of books when there is no space left elsewhere, in the limited space between other people's lives. People and houses are imprisoning. It is only in the printed word that Lorna can breathe; even then she feels Grandpa looking over her shoulder as she reads. Sage is interested in lives that don't fit: family black sheep, misshapen marriages, homes too small to house either the hatred of their inhabitants or their exclusive love. Either way, other people are hell. Having lived sandwiched between these two marriages, Sage, believing she is still a virgin, unwittingly finds herself pregnant at 16 and embarking on her own marriage. Both she and Victor, the child's father, are doing their A-levels. It is here that the story closes, and it is given a happy ending. A daughter, Sharon, is born; Victor and Lorna both gain firsts in English from Durham University, and both join the English department at the new University of East Anglia. There are no doubt many other endings she might have chosen, but Sage breaks off at the point at which her life, if not her blood, became her own.TopicsBiography booksreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He believes them to be Democrats. He considers them to be little mean hillary clintons covered all over with feminist legfur.\u201d Patricia Lockwood\u2019s dazzling comic memoir is set in midwest America and centres on a man who likes to clean his gun, listen to Rush Limbaugh and drink from a mug that reads \u201cI love my \u2018white-collar\u2019 job\u201d \u2013 despite being married with five children, he is a Catholic priest. Father Lockwood, as presented here, is a truly unusual man. Upstairs in the family home, he shreds his electric guitar in a prog-rock frenzy and sips cream liqueurs (\u201cHe looked like a gigantic brownie drinking drops of dew\u201d). He has a habit of yelling out \u201cHoooo-eee\u201d for no particular reason, cooks a great deal of meat and dresses either in his full priestly regalia or nothing but his underwear (\u201cHe was wearing his most formal boxer shorts, the ones you could almost not see through\u201d).When Patricia was 19, in 2002, she met her future husband Jason on an internet poetry forum. She was living at home \u2013 her father, a \u201cloose, lazy pile of carnality\u201d, was happy to spend money on himself but unable to fund his children through college. After months of exchanged messages, Jason drove from Colorado to Missouri finally to meet her. He half-assumed she would be \u201cfifty years old and Latina\u201d; Lockwood in turn was worried that poets \u201cwere the sort of people who said \u2018lo\u2019 in conversation\u201d. Her parents were naturally wary of the stranger, and Jason was greeted by her father with the screech: \u201cGimme your license. I got cop friends.\u201d Though an immediate marriage proposal took place \u2013 \u201cin the parking lot of \u2026 the most matrimonial of all grocery stores\u201d \u2013 her mother and father were convinced Tricia was about to drive off with a murderer. It was her sister Mary who pointed out that \u201cWe are the ones who are not normal\u201d.The outline of Lockwood\u2019s family story has been known since she was interviewed in the aftermath of \u201cRape Joke\u201d, her autobiographical poem that, when published in 2013, instantly found a vast online audience. She was at that time already \u201cindie-poetry royalty\u201d, in the phrase of the New York Times, thanks to her first collection of poems, Balloon Pop Outlaw Black, and was celebrated too for her \u201csexts\u201d on Twitter. (Here are three, from 2011-13: \u201cSext: Botany Class. I do leaf rubbing after leaf rubbing until the teacher kicks me out for Moaning too much\u201d; \u201cSext: I am a water glass at the Inquisition. You are a dry pope mouth. You pucker; I wet you\u201d; \u201cSext: I am a Dan Brown novel and you do me in my plot-hole. \u2018Wow,\u2019 I yell in ecstasy, \u2018this makes no sense at all\u2019\u201d.) Called, perhaps too often, the poet laureate of Twitter, she drily notes in Priestdaddy that it took the social-media commotion attendant on \u201cRape Joke\u201d for mainstream publishers to come calling: the poem was the centrepiece of Motherland Fatherland Homelandsexuals, her second collection, which showcased what the Atlantic magazine has described as her \u201cwitty, sexually slippery, polymorphous and Millennially mischievous\u201d work.The writing of a memoir was prompted by Lockwood\u2019s return, complete with husband and cat, and after 12 years away, to live with her parents, \u201cpenniless, exhausted\u201d. Jason was an editor on a small newspaper, who believed he was \u201cdestined to be a sort of Leonard Woolf figure\u201d; the couple accepted their \u201cpinched circumstances\u201d. When Jason developed a rare eye condition, and they had to raise $10,000 for treatment, Lockwood appealed to her Twitter followers and the money was collected within a day. But the operation went wrong; Jason needed further procedures, and could no longer work. Their only option was a room in the rectory (a sign outside the house reads \u201cGod answers knee-mail\u201d). During their nine-month stay, Lockwood finds herself \u201cjotting down everything everyone says, as fast and free as it comes out of their mouths\u201d. Her mother rises \u201cto heights of quotability exceeded only by Confucius, Muhammad Ali\u201d; her father shouts at the TV \u201cI like Chunky Soup \u2026 oh yeah\u201d.Rape Joke: what is Patricia Lockwood's poem really saying?Read moreThe New Yorker has described Lockwood as \u201can exemplar of brilliant silliness\u201d, and Priestdaddy is indeed brilliantly silly, with much comedy squeezed out of her Catholic upbringing. (Rumours of Satanists are rife, and new religious robes incite the comment: \u201cThe embroidery! Do you see the detail on those lambs!\u201d) But the book strikes other notes. It would have been impossible not to address the church\u2019s record on child sexual abuse, especially when \u201cthe topic of which priests had been removed from their parishes \u2026 was discussed over the dinner table\u201d; the \u201ccode of silence\u201d exerted a great power. She reveals that, as a 16-year-old, she took 100 painkiller tablets and had to have her stomach pumped (\u201cSex would probably have helped,\u201d she says of her teenage angst, \u201cbut the only thing I was having sex with then was the intolerable sadness of the human condition, which sucked so much in bed\u201d). Between the jokes, there is a fleeting mention of her \u201cchildlessness\u201d.Lockwood\u2019s father was an atheist when he married her mother. He converted when he was working as a naval seaman, serving on a nuclear submarine, and the family legend is that it was due to multiple underwater screenings of The Exorcist: \u201cthat eerie, pea-soup light was pouring down, and all around him men in sailor suits were getting the bejesus scared out of them, and the bejesus flew into my father like a dart into a bull\u2019s eye\u201d. Gregory Lockwood dubbed it \u201cthe deepest conversion on record\u201d. He became a Lutheran pastor, but later presented himself for ordination as a married Catholic priest, which required a special dispensation from the pope. In due time, he made his terrorised children watch The Exorcist as a \u201ctender rite of passage\u201d: \u201cMy father attempted to mute the line \u2018Your mother sucks cocks in hell!\u2019 but hit the wrong button on the remote and actually ended up blasting it at maximum volume.\u201dLockwood grew up with pro-life bumper stickers on the family car; she was taken by her parents to anti-abortion rallies. During her early teenage years, she attended a religious youth group called God\u2019s Gang, where they spoke in tongues, were told in detail about the sex they shouldn\u2019t have, and sang such refrains as \u201cHe\u2019s a peach of a saviour /He\u2019s the apple of my eyes \u2026 And that\u2019s why I\u2019m bananas for the Lord!\u201d She carried a card inscribed with the virginity pledge \u201cTrue Love Waits\u201d, and didn\u2019t disclose that she had already lost her hymen (she called it her \u201cherman\u201d) when she hit the water after jumping off a high diving board: \u201cSuddenly I felt romantic towards the aqua-blue water. I scissored through it in languid strokes and pictured the baby we might make together.\u201dPriestdaddy is a haphazard coming-of-age story, but also an account of a writer forming a highly individual worldviewPriestdaddy is a haphazard coming-of-age story, but also an account of a writer forming a highly individual worldview, and finding an audience. Lockwood describes the composing of \u201cRape Joke\u201d \u2013 \u201cIt came all at once \u2026 Beads along a razor blade, but now I controlled the cut\u201d. The poem recalls an incident from her late teens: \u201cThe rape joke is that you were 19 years old. / The rape joke is that he was your boyfriend. / The rape joke it wore a goatee. A goatee.\u201d Having been told about the rape, her priestdaddy made the sign of the cross over her head and absolved her of her sins. Lockwood\u2019s poems often explore the objectification of, and violence against, women. In this memoir, which depicts her charismatic, dominating father with no malice, she notes: \u201cI know all women are supposed to be strong enough now to strangle presidents and patriarchies between their powerful thighs, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. Many of us were actually affected, by male systems and male anger, in ways we cannot always articulate or overcome.\u201dIn the section entitled \u201cThe Cum Queens of Hyatt Place\u201d, Lockwood recounts a trip she makes with her mother, who, on arriving for the first time in a hotel room, finds semen stains on the sheets: \u201cThis is a Catholic\u2019s worst nightmare, souls all over the bed.\u201d They wonder who was responsible. \u201cI think it was probably a businessman,\u201d Lockwood remarks, \u201cwith a hotel fetish, who shouted the word \u2018amenities!\u2019 as he came.\u201d Her mother responds, without a pause: \u201cA jizzness man, you mean.\u201d Karen Lockwood, it turns out, understands \u201cPun Lightning, that jolt of connection\u201d, and Priestdaddy becomes in one sense a tribute to her, both as an endless resource of love and care, and an intellectual kindred spirit.At the end of the book, Patricia and Jason have moved out of the rectory, and everything is more possible, less desperate. On a cherished holiday in Key West, Florida, Lockwood looks back, in a fine sentence, to previous stays there: \u201cNext to the sea we were submerged, and what we said in the middle of the night did not matter, it was just breathing \u2026 silvery bubbles that wobbled up through the depths.\u201d But family remains closer than it was, and on this vacation her mother is with them, liberated for a while from her crazed home and husband. Happy and full of champagne, she drunkenly proclaims \u2013 as her daughter undoubtedly would \u2013 \u201cI love language\u201d. Priestdaddy is published by Allen Lane.

Before welcoming Greece\u2019s embattled finance minister to the Oval Office, the then president told his Greek-American audience: \u201cI might as well walk up to him and ask to borrow some money.\u201d The presidential joke fell flat. Greece had become the object of mirth and bullying by the major powers. Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s six-month tenure was a story of almost daily confrontations with the IMF, the European institutions and, most of all, with a German government that seemingly held him in contempt.Varoufakis has had his revenge, or perhaps catharsis, by writing a riveting hiss and tell. Adults in the Room, borrowing a term used pejoratively by Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, provides an extraordinary account of low cunning at the heart of Greece\u2019s 2015 financial bailout. The more defiant the leftwing Syriza government became, the more it\u00a0was met with intimidation from some or duplicitous reassurance from others. The most venal of the first category was Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s hard-as-nails finance minister. He was joined by various EU bureaucrats who will soon be negotiating against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit crew. One of the most intriguing members of the \u201ctrust me, we\u2019d really like to help you, but when push comes to shove, we won\u2019t\u201d camp was Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s new president. Macron promised to help and he did try, but he came up against the stumbling block of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. His embarrassed boss intimated that he had been put in his place by Angela Merkel.This necessarily is a partial interpretation of history \u2013 the version of one man, a motorcycling, leather jacketed former academic and self-styled rebel who took pleasure in winding up the besuited political class. Varoufakis\u2019s choice of friends is bizarre, but in keeping with our febrile times. He cites with unabashed pleasure the support he regularly received from Lord Lamont, the ex-chancellor said by his wife to have been in the bath when the UK hurtled out of the ERM, and Jeffrey Sachs, one of the architects of Russia\u2019s disastrous crash privatisation programme of the early 1990s.Yanis Varoufakis: \u2018If I\u2019m convicted of high treason, it would be interesting\u2019Read moreJust as the Brexiters and the British right choose their enemy\u2019s enemy as their friend, so it should come as no surprise that the Greek left might do the same. Nor should it seem incongruous that the Telegraph bought the serialisation rights to this book, lavishing it with praise. It should be noted that the paper was not a fan when Varoufakis was in situ, inveighing at the \u201celite\u201d two years ago. Political allegiances have since become endlessly flexible.One can retain an open mind about his version while still admiring the tenacity of the protagonist. He says that he recorded many of his conversations: if so, political history by smartphone would be a new variant of the more traditional diary entry at the end of the working day. No conversation is really private, nor when it comes to political skulduggery should it be.Thus Varoufakis claims that both Lagarde and Sch\u00e4uble admitted to him that the medicine couldn\u2019t work, but they had to administer it anyway. \u201cAs a patriot, no. It\u2019s bad for your people,\u201d he claims the German said to him. Their many conversations are the most riveting. At one point, Varoufakis tells Sch\u00e4uble: \u201cDuring the Black Death of the 14th century, I reminded him, most Europeans believed the plague was caused by sinful living and could be exorcised by bloodletting and self-flagellation.\u201d Oh to have been a fly on the wall.It is the weak, particularly the Greek prime minister and erstwhile friend Alexis Tsipras, who earn the greatest scorn. Varoufakis watches as his cabinet colleagues are picked off, culminating, oddly, in a referendum in which Greece\u2019s voters opt by a comfortable margin to reject Brussels\u2019 austerity terms, only for Tsipras to reject his own victory and cave in to even stronger terms than had originally been envisaged. \u201cHe followed his usual practice of agreeing with everything I said but drawing the opposite conclusion.\u201dI would like to hear the others\u2019 versions. In time, surely, they will come. He dips into the theme of Greece\u2019s endemic corruption, sometimes dismissing its relevance to the crisis, or to claim \u2013 with little evidence \u2013 that his enemies are complicit. He blames the media for many of his woes, a somewhat tired lament.Varoufakis paints himself as a flawed hero, but very much the hero. Still, the strengths of this account far outweigh the weaknesses. This is an admirably believable depiction of a Greek and European tragedy. Amid the drama, there is bathos. Varoufakis forgets his coat in Paris and has to borrow one from Greece\u2019s ambassador; on another occasion, he accepts chocolate euro coins as a sardonic gift from Sch\u00e4uble, only for them to melt in his jacket pocket, smudging the resignation letter he planned to issue on his return home.Admirably, he eschews denunciations, finding the human in his adversaries, even in his darkest moments. He writes of midnight walks through the rainy streets of Brussels or Riga or wherever the latest fraught meeting had just taken place. \u201cHow the human mind forges vistas of pleasure out of pure bleakness is a fascinating mystery.\u201dThe next time I think I have had a bad day in the office, I will remember that someone has had much worse.

Joan Bakewell cheers him on Buy The God Delusion at the Guardian bookshopBuy The God Delusion at the Guardian bookshopJoan BakewellSun 24 Sep 2006 08.49 AESTThe God Delusion\nby Richard Dawkins\n416pp, Bantam, \u00a320In September 1997 Richard Dawkins allowed an Australian film crew into his Oxford home, only to realise in the course of a particularly inept interview that they were creationists trying to trap him. Tumbling to this, he paused some moments while deciding whether to throw them out or attempt a long and thoughtful explanation that they didn't want to hear. In their resulting film, his hesitation is dishonestly edited to look like intellectual doubt on his part. Creationists and believers in God are right to see him as their arch-enemy. In The God Delusion he displays what a formidable adversary he is. It is a spirited and exhilarating read. In the current climate of papal/Islamic stand-off, it is timely too.There is no hesitancy or doubt here. Dawkins comes roaring forth in the full vigour of his powerful arguments, laying into fallacies and false doctrines with the energy of the polemicist at his most fiery. \"My earlier books did not set out to convert anyone ... this book does,\" he declares. Its tone is chattier than usual, given to conversational asides, even urgent pleadings - \"Please, please raise your consciousness about this!\" he begs about the religious indoctrination of tiny children. And should you doubt his intent, an appendix lists \"friendly addresses for individuals needing support in escaping from religion\". The words \"humanist\", \"rationalist\", \"secular\", \"atheist\" dot those addresses. Dawkins is, if he will excuse the word, on a crusade.Perhaps he won't excuse the word. It is the slack use of words and the misunderstanding of metaphor that he sees as underpinning the cases made for the existence of a deity. He starts with some sharp definitions of his own: God he takes to mean \"a supernatural creator it is appropriate to worship\"; pantheism \"is sexed-up atheism. Deism is watered-down theism\". There are plenty of \"isms\" to choose from, but to Dawkins they all smack of compromise. He is an out-and-out atheist and this is his testimony.With his usual rational skills he sets about dissecting the arguments for the existence of a God. He takes on all comers: Aquinas's five \"proofs\", Pascal's wager (meant as a joke, surely), even Stephen Unwin's probability of God, whose use of Bayes' theorem to demonstrate the probability of God Dawkins scathingly dismisses as \"quite agreeably funny\". He puts in its place the believers' misunderstanding of Darwinism. No, it does not mean that we are all here by chance, but by a scientifically demonstrable process of natural selection. His scorn for believers is evident throughout. He speaks of \"a mind hijacked by religion\" and finds \"sucking up to God\" a strange rationale for doing good. He is, not surprisingly, appalled by the jealous rage of the God of the Old Testament (lovingly putting Abraham to the test of killing his only son) and has sharp things to say about the ubiquitous weirdness of the Bible, \"a chaotically cobbled together anthology of disjointed documents\". When sophisticated believers claim disarmingly that \"we don't take Genesis literally any more,\" he rails \"That is my whole point!\" It's as much a pick-and-mix philosophy as believers accuse atheists of. What's more, plenty of people still do take the Bible literally. According to Gallup approximately 50% of the US electorate believe the story of Noah.Dawkins has a lot of easy fun on the wilder shores of religion, but he has serious things to say about why morality doesn't need faith. His argument gathers strength as he enumerates the many ways in which religion is excessively privileged in our supposedly secular society. Christian groups on US campuses are even now campaigning against anti-discrimination laws that protect homosexuals. They have widespread support for their \"freedom of religion\". Dawkins cites Britain's own educational scandal which is gifting a series of city academies to a rich car salesman who believes in creationism and has \u00a32m to buy his way in. A letter of protest from eight bishops and nine scientists got a perfunctory reply from Tony Blair. Plans for more faith schools go forward. Many of us who might want to stay outside theological debate can't afford to when it is influencing social policy.Dawkins reserves particular venom for those religious apologists who claim distinguished scientists as their own. He sneers at \"the Faustian road to the Templeton prize\", the world's largest single financial prize - \u00a3800,000 in 2006 - for \"progress concerning spiritual values\". No atheists sit on the jury and winners are increasingly likely to be scientists who use the \"God\" word. When Einstein declared that \"God does not play dice\" he was rounded up by believers as proof that the finest minds shared their superstitions. Similarly, when Stephen Hawking ended his book A Brief History of Time with the phrase \"then we shall know the mind of God\", its sales were set to roar away. Weren't the planet's greatest scientists endorsing the views of the faithful? The answer is \"no\", and Dawkins unpicks the dangers attendant on any scientist using the word. If they use the word God to mean the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then he admits he himself would, in that sense, be religious. Certainly his books pay lyrical tribute to the awe and beauty of what exists in the physical world. But to use \"God in that sense is misleading\". As Carl Sagan put it, \"it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity\".Dawkins's most original contribution is the examination of why religion has persisted so long after the scientific revolution, and indeed is staging a global comeback of terrifying proportions. He cites his own concept, the meme, the social equivalent of the gene, as the way ideas are spread and handed down. As a Darwinian he is keen to understand what is so beneficial about religion that makes it eligible for survival. He has an interesting theory - exemplified by the moth being attracted to the flame and thus to its death - that an arcane survival mechanism is operating in grossly distorted circumstances.Believers wrongly accuse Dawkins of being himself a fundamentalist, a fundamentalist atheist. He argues the difference: that given proof he was wrong he would at once change his opinions, whereas the true fundamentalist clings to his faith whatever the challenge. What he doesn't satisfactorily answer is the sense that people of faith have of the divine, a true experience for them that encompasses love and joy and celebration - all the things Dawkins finds in the physical world. He doesn't comprehend that for many people reasoned argument is not the final arbiter of how they choose to live their lives. They are swayed by feelings, moved by loyalties, willing to set logic aside for the sake of psychic comfort. Tell them that all this is the product of chemical and electrical activity in the brain and they will at best assert that God made it thus. For decades now we have been willing to let such diversity of unverifiable beliefs exist among a democratic tolerance of ideas. But this, the assumption of the secular outlook, can no longer be taken for granted. The clouds are darkening around tolerance.These are now political matters. Around the world communities are increasingly defined as Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and living peaceably together is ever harder to sustain. Champions of each faith maintain its superiority to the rest. Recent remarks by Pope Benedict XVI show the man in his true colours: an absolutist pointing up with intellectual precision the incompatibility of Islam and Christianity. He did this long before he was Pope, writing the declaration of John Paul II that all religions other than the Catholic faith were defective. Since his election he has demoted efforts at rapprochement with Islam and, on a visit to Auschwitz, failed to address the papacy's collusion with Nazism. The Pope is, of course, held to be infallible by the Catholic church. Islam's response to all this - \"if you dare to say we're a violent religion, then we'll kill you!\" - compounds not only the idiocy of rival dogmas but also the dangers. Islam's sharia law invests the law of the land with its own religious and often brutal priorities. Apostasy is punishable by death, as is homosexuality. Christian observance is put under increasing pressure. Dawkins is right to be not only angry but alarmed. Religions have the secular world running scared. This book is a clarion call to cower no longer. Primed by anger, redeemed by humour, it will, I trust, offend many.\u00b7 Joan Bakewell's book Belief is published by DuckworthTopicsBooksScience and nature booksRichard DawkinsReligionreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Sheila BurnettKathryn HughesFri 6 Apr 2018 16.30 AESTLast modified on Sat 7 Apr 2018 09.10 AESTThere\u2019s a wonderful moment in a series of wonderful moments in this second instalment of Deborah Levy\u2019s \u201cliving memoir\u201d. It\u2019s\u00a0a \u201csad Tuesday\u201d and she is being told off by a neighbour in the block of flats into which she has recently moved with her daughters following divorce from their\u00a0father. This is supposed to be a fresh start for Levy, a liberation from the contortions of a family life that has become too difficult to sustain alongside her work as a writer. But\u00a0now here comes a new kind of cultural policing, imposed not by a man but by another woman, who is part of what Levy calls the \u201csocietal\u201d system.With her sharp little teeth, rictus smile and high sweet voice, the woman is dripping gentle venom about Levy\u2019s habit of parking her bike in the front car park, her resistance to ordering her shopping online like everyone else, not to mention the fact that she appears so \u201cbusy busy busy all the time\u201d. As the teeth get pointier, Levy\u2019s necklace, the one she always wears even when swimming, breaks and the large pearls bounce across the entrance hall floor. She is\u00a0unstrung, undone in this place where she was supposed to be aiming for a \u201cnew composition\u201d.A good 30 years after someone clever and optimistic (no one is quite sure who) first announced that we had landed safely on the shores of \u201cpost-feminism\u201d, it\u2019s clear that being both a creative and reproductive woman is as tricky as it\u2019s ever been. As with Freud\u2019s return of the repressed, those angers and desires, the consequence of botched compromise and thankless sacrifice, have come bubbling up, all the more potent for being choked for so long. Into this molten moment some of our finest writers including Rachel Cusk, Maggie Nelson and, indeed, Levy have poured their blistering experiences of the psychic and emotional cost of being a wife and mother in the 21st century.Love and liberty \u2026 Simone de Beauvoir with Jean-Paul Sartre in Paris, 1940. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex FeaturesLevy\u2019s oblique and elliptical prose, on magnificent show in her Booker shortlisted novels Swimming Home and Hot Milk, does not lend itself to a route march through chronological time and external circumstance. Instead, what Levy gives us is an account of her internal world, a shape-shifting space where past and present coexist, where buildings are\u00a0not so much bricks and mortar as extended metaphors and where identity is in a radical flux of\u00a0unravelling and remaking.All the same, Levy\u2019s prose is not so slippery that it can\u2019t serve up the basics. At the age of 50 and after decades of what sound like the usual patterns of north London family-making, she finds herself cast adrift from her marriage and, crucially, without any\u00a0desire to swim back. We\u2019re not given names or details, but that is not so much a matter of tact as irrelevance, since the story Levy tells, she insists, does not belong to her alone. It is the story of every woman throughout history who has expended her love and labour on making a home that turns out to serve the needs of everyone except herself.Levy is not shy to elevate her drama to the realm of the immortals but is picky about which mythologies she co-optsNot that getting free is exactly easy. Indeed, as Levy\u2019s wry title suggests, choosing not to be married to society costs a lot. Her comfortable family home has been exchanged for a flat where the heating often doesn\u2019t work and the lavatory often won\u2019t flush. The communal parts \u2013 there are 100 flats in this huge block \u2013 are a hallucinatory tube that she dubs \u201cthe Corridors of Love\u201d. This sounds promising, but Levy\u2019s most rewarding experiences turn out to be with an electronic screwdriver that bites efficiently into spoiled old wood, and her new electric bike, which whizzes her home along the Holloway Road with the groceries. She pays for the screwdriver and the e-bike, not to mention the groceries and her daughters\u2019 trainers, by taking teaching and writing jobs that, she hints, are not ones that she would otherwise choose.Into this present tense Levy inserts incidents that reveal the conditions that made her want to break away from the family racket in the first place. She tells us about a man she knows who can\u2019t look at his wife, another who never remembers women\u2019s names, and a\u00a0downstairs neighbour who invites her in for a drink but whom she actually values for the loan of his power tools. Working further back, earlier encounters show her dealing with random men who take up too much space, time and air in cafes, on trains and in conversation, barging into her narrative as if it is their natural right.It is to counteract this sense of diminishment that she sets about expanding her own domain. A neighbour, the elderly widow of the poet Adrian Mitchell, offers Levy her garden shed as a writing hut. It is a\u00a0provisional kind of liberation, though, shared with a fuming deep freeze and a gas heater that makes the place sweat. Still, in case there is any doubt about the\u00a0allegories in play, Levy describes this particular Garden of Eden as having its own abundant apple tree (the fruit goes splat on the shed roof) and a loving gardener-god who tends to all living things (in fact a\u00a0handsome out-of-work actor).\u2018What\u2019s the point of a risk-free life?\u2019 \u2013 Deborah Levy on starting again at 50Read moreAs the biblical allusions suggest, Levy is never shy\u00a0about elevating her personal drama to the realm of the immortals. Still, she remains picky about which mythologies she is willing to co-opt in the process. Penelope patiently waiting at home for Odysseus to return from his adventures definitely will not do. Instead, Levy prefers to tell us about the Medusa who dares to return the male gaze, transforming all those gawpers into stone. Then there are\u00a0the Maenads, the raving female followers of Bacchus\u00a0who remind her of her friend Sasha, a high-flying city woman who goes out to get blind drunk every Friday. In an extravagant gesture of refusal Sasha always ends up being sick over her short-skirted business suit and high heels, a\u00a0fantasy uniform of female empowerment that could only have been dreamed up by\u00a0a\u00a0male boss.Femininity for Levy, then, is a kind of shoddy masquerade, an elaborate costuming of body and desire that she no longer has any interest in maintaining. There\u2019s nothing new about this idea. You see it in early radical psychoanalytical circles before it disappeared as\u00a0the 20th century unfolded, pushed off stage\u00a0by more pressing anxieties about life and death. After the second world war, Simone de Beauvoir re-engaged with the idea of gender as performance, only to see the thread get lost again in the 1980s and 90s with the emergence of so-called \u201clipstick feminism\u201d, a mode that positively relished the dressing-up side of things.Now, in The Cost of Living, Levy explicitly recuperates De Beauvoir\u2019s position, not only by engaging closely with The Second Sex, but by going deeply into the philosopher\u2019s personal struggles to reconcile sexual love with intellectual liberty. The result is a\u00a0piece of work that is not so much a memoir as an eloquent manifesto for what Levy calls \u201ca new way of\u00a0living\u201d in the post-familial world.\u00a0The Cost of Living is published by Hamish Hamiltion.

That book showed that Gaiman had a rich imagination, a clear and effective prose style, and an ability to tackle large themes. So I was looking forward to Coraline, his new children's novel, and I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I was enthralled. The story occupies a territory somewhere between Lewis Carroll's Alice and Catherine Storr's classic fantasy of warning and healing, Marianne Dreams. Coraline lives alone with her parents in a flat in an old house, the other flats being occupied by an eccentric old man who trains mice, and two elderly retired actresses. Coraline's parents are kindly but absent-minded and preoccupied with their work, so Coraline - who seems to be about Alice's age - has had to rely on herself, not only for entertainment, but also for sensible things like eating and washing and putting herself to bed. The narrative voice is not Coraline's, but hers are the only thoughts and feelings we are told about, so she is at the centre of the story. This is the best point of view from which to tell a story about a child: the telling voice is an adult's, so it can plausibly observe and say things a child would not, but all the sympathy is with the child. Gaiman brings it off with a skill that you wouldn't notice unless you were looking for it. And the matter-of-fact tone is important, because this is a marvellously strange and scary book. When Coraline finds a door that opens into another flat strangely like her own, but subtly different (thus making the classic transition from here, where we live, to there, where the mysteries begin), we believe what we're told. And when she discovers a sinister woman there, who looks a little like her mother but has eyes that are big black buttons, the matter-of-factness of the woman's response when Coraline says \"Who are you?\" is both disarming and terrifying. \"I'm your other mother,\" she says. And so begins a struggle for Coraline's soul. Gaiman is too intelligent and subtle to invoke the supernatural - this is much more mysterious than that - and too wise to let Coraline face the horrors alone: she has an ally in a sardonic and very feline cat. But the dangers are real, and part of the richness of the story comes from the fact that it offers many meanings without imposing any. For example, when the other mother shows Coraline a mirror in which she sees her real parents, and hears them seeming to say \"How nice it is, not to have Coraline any more . . . Now we can do all the things we always wanted to do,\" we can see for a moment what it would be like to read the story as the acting-out of some unconscious sense of rejection on Coraline's part; but it is touched on so lightly that a moment later it's left behind. The story is much too clever to be caught in the net of a single interpretation. Gaiman's ear is acute. At one point the other mother says of Coraline's real parents: \"If they have left you, Coraline, it must be because they became bored with you,\" to which Coraline replies stoutly: \"They weren't bored of me.\" With and of: the words catch their two voices exactly. This invention reaches to the smallest details. In the other flat, the toys are alive: at one point a little tank tips over on its back in its eagerness to greet her, and when Coraline sets it upright, it flees under the bed in embarrassment. There is much more. There is the creepy atmosphere of the other flat - the scariest apartment since the one in David Lynch's film Lost Highway; there is the tender and beautifully judged ending; and above all, there is Coraline herself, brave and frightened, self-reliant and doubtful, and finally triumphant. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, rise to your feet and applaud: Coraline is the real thing. \u00b7 Philip Pullman is the author of the Dark Materials trilogy (Scholastic).TopicsBooksChildren and teenagersNeil GaimanPhilip PullmanreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Click for full image.\nPhotograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesJustine JordanThu 14 Feb 2013 19.01 AEDTJim Crace's literary inheritance, he's said, is not so much the world of books as \"the thousands of years of unwritten narrative, the oral tradition\". His novels often reach beyond the limits of the historical record: to the advent of the bronze age in The Gift of Stones, to Christ's sojourn in the Judean desert in\u00a0Quarantine, to the new dark age of a\u00a0future America in The Pesthouse. Harvest, his latest novel, dramatises one of the great under-told narratives of English history: the forced enclosure of open fields and common land from the late medieval era on, whereby subsistence agriculture was replaced by profitable wool production and the peasant farmers dispossessed and displaced. \"The sheaf is giving way to sheep\", as Crace puts it here, and an immemorial connection between people and their local environment is being broken.But how do you tell the story of a settlement too insignificant to have a\u00a0name, and peasants whose only signatures are their scything styles? Crace needs an observant outsider, which is where Walter Thirsk comes in. Though the novel begins in the plural, as \"we\" are summoned from the harvest by ominous smoke over the manor house, Walter quickly establishes his individual voice. He came to the village in the service of Master Kent, who married the daughter of the manor 12 years ago; fell in love with a local; and has worked the land since. Both men are now widowers, and retain an uneasy familiarity dating back to boyhood, when Walter's mother suckled them both \u2013 \"brothers in milk\", but not family. Walter counts himself part of the village community, but \u2013 appropriately for a book that is all about power and belonging and ownership \u2013 will find himself alienated from gentlemen and labourers alike when the timeless certainties of village life are overturned. \"I never was a local tree, grown in this soil from seed, to die where I was planted.\"Several strangers broach the village: two men and a dangerously alluring woman, already dispossessed by enclosure elsewhere; the new lord of the manor Master Jordan, come to reclaim his family property from Master Kent, who as a widower without heirs has no claim on the manor house he married into; Mr Quill, employed to map and measure the area to prepare it for the enclosure that Master Kent hoped to introduce by consent and Master Jordan is only too happy to push through by force. The villagers' suspicion and scapegoating of the trio cowering in a thrown-together shack on the common land sets in train a series of violent events that empties the village and only smoothes the path to enclosure. Not, as Walter realises, that change could ever have been averted: \"Dissent is never counted; it is weighed. The master always weighs the most.\" Master Jordan promises to provide Christ as well as capitalism: he will pay for a church to be built in the village at last, with a bell to summon those permitted to remain to prayer \u2013 and hurry them to work.Crace brings his signature combination of atmosphere and exactitude to every aspect of this far\u2011off world, from landscape and ploughing to domestic interiors and the taste of magic mushrooms (a \"reasty mix of horse's hoofs, burnt hair and candle wax\"). The prose is extraordinary: rich yet measured, estranged and familiar, both intimate and austere. The narrative, though, proceeds by odd fits and starts, tracking back and forwards in time as Walter, struggling to resolve the train of consequence, reconstructs past events and considers future possibilities, guesses at others' motivations, resolves to act, hesitates,\u00a0does not. It becomes gradually apparent that he is absent from nearly all the key scenes, as though the book is enacting his own exclusion from the community to which he believes he belongs.There are many mysteries and flights of fancy in the novel, but few answers. In the end Walter is most closely allied with Mr Quill, the romantic mapmaker, who \u2013 like the storyteller in The Gift of Stones \u2013 is excluded from the world of practical work by his damaged arm. Walter also damages his hand, forcing him to abandon the toil of the harvest for intellectual labour helping Quill to chart the area. Quill's map gives Walter a different perspective on his world: not only a bird's-eye view, but an abstract representation of something previously unmediated by anything other than his own senses. \"I have my blues,\" he thinks defensively, as he watches Quill mix up colours and remembers various skies he's seen. The\u00a0map is \"effortless: a lie. He hasn't captured time ... No man has ever seen\u00a0this view.\"Throughout the novel the certainty of the land, the \"busy, kindly, scented universe of crops and the unerring traces of its calendar\", is set against the human urge to shape the world into stories, to guess and theorise and surmise. Stories grounded in the landscape also loom large, in customs such as choosing the gleaning queen when the harvest is brought in, or bumping heads against boundary stones to affirm the limits of the local world. What will change with enclosure is that sense of balance: \"This land,\" Master Kent says, \"has always been much older than ourselves\u00a0... Not any more.\" The environmental crisis we are facing now is on a global as well as a local level. Harvest can be read in mythical, even biblical terms, but the physical and emotional displacement of individuals and communities at its heart remains as politically resonant today as it was at\u00a0the time.TopicsBooksJim CracefeaturesReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Jan ThijsForeign objects \u2026 Amy Adams in Arrival. Photograph: Jan ThijsPeter Bradshaw@PeterBradshaw1Thu 1 Sep 2016 23.54 AESTLast modified on Fri 23 Feb 2018 07.27 AEDTDenis Villeneuve\u2019s sci-fi contact drama is dreamy, freaky, audacious. It skirts the edge of absurdity, as anything like this must, but manages to keep clear, and it includes a big flourish in the manner of early films by M Night Shyamalan, which adroitly finesses the narrative issue of what exactly to do with a movie about aliens showing up on Earth.I have been agnostic about this kind of movie recently, after the overwrought disappointments of Christopher Nolan\u2019s Interstellar and Jeff Nichols\u2019s Midnight Special. But Villeneuve\u2019s Arrival is both heartfelt and very entertaining.As is now expected with this kind of film, the protagonist is a flustered, bewildered civilian with special expertise, brusquely pressed into service by the military, which has got the spacecraft surrounded in the short term.Amy Adams is Dr Louise Banks, a professor of comparative linguistics with nothing and no one in her life but her work. But as it happens, Dr Banks was once seconded as a military adviser to translate a video of insurgents speaking Farsi. So when a dozen giant spaceships land in 12 different locations on Earth (including Devon \u2013 sadly there no scenes there), each looking like a bisected rugby ball standing on end, a bunch of army guys led by Col Weber (Forest Whitaker) show up on Louise\u2019s doorstep, demanding she come with them to help translate what the aliens are saying. Why, you ask, did they not approach Noam Chomsky, with his understanding of \u201cdeep structure\u201d in language? Perhaps Prof Chomsky did not care to help America\u2019s military-intelligence complex.At any rate, Louise\u2019s liaison is the flirtatious Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), a military scientist who, in a stereotypical and fallacious way, equates his masculinity with science and affects to despise what he sees as the softer discipline of linguistics. Michael Stuhlbarg plays Halpern, the glowering CIA chief. But unbeknown to them, there is a secret tragedy in Louise\u2019s life: a lost child, dead of cancer in her late teens. Her attempts to communicate with the aliens cause painful but illuminating echoes in her mind.If a lion could speak, said Wittgenstein, we would not understand him. Does the same go for aliens? Spielberg solved this issue elegantly in Close Encounters of the Third Kind by making the form of communication a five-note musical phrase, ending questioningly on the dominant. Villeneuve\u2019s solution is more literal. The aliens have a code which \u2013 a little preposterously \u2013 Louise finds herself more or less able to crack, with the crowdsourced expertise of the other 11 human-contact teams around the globe. But it is her human intuition, vulnerability and spontaneity that finally enable her to reach out to the visitors.\nArrival trailer: Amy Adams makes first contact with aliens GuardianInevitably, these \u201ccontact\u201d moments are where the film\u2019s real impact and atmosphere have to be. And Villeneuve doesn\u2019t disappoint in sequences of eerie and claustrophobic strangeness \u2013 though I concede the film is most effective before the physical form of the aliens is revealed. There are also touches of comedy: Ian and Louise decide, for convenience\u2019s sake, to nickname two aliens Abbott and Costello \u2013 maybe in homage to the linguistic misunderstanding in the duo\u2019s famous routine about a baseball team\u2019s positions.By coolly switching focus to political intrigue and betrayal within the human ranks, Villeneuve keeps a grip on his story and creates ballast for its departure into the realms of the visionary and supernatural. And he also prepares us for the film\u2019s sense that language itself, freed of our usual sense of its linear form, might be more important than anyone thought. (I wonder if Villeneuve has seen the 2010 documentary Into Eternity, by Danish film-maker Michael Madsen, about attempts to devise a new universal language to label underground repositories of nuclear waste \u2013 labels whose warnings have to be understood by future humans whose language has evolved away from what we know now.)Arrival is a big, risky, showy movie which jumps up on its high-concept highwire and disdains a net. And yes, there are moments of silliness when it wobbles a little, but it provides you with spectacle and fervent romance.\nThis article was corrected on 7 November 2016. An earlier version said Abbott and Costello\u2019s famous routine was about a baseball batting order. It was about a fielding team\u2019s positions.\nTopicsArrivalFirst look reviewVenice film festival 2016Science fiction and fantasy filmsVenice film festivalFestivalsAmy AdamsJeremy RennerreviewsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Economic growth has done as much as it can to improve material conditions in the developed countries, and in some cases appears to be damaging health. If Britain were instead to concentrate on making its citizens' incomes as equal as those of people in Japan and Scandinavia, we could each have seven extra weeks' holiday a year, we would be thinner, we would each live a year or so longer, and we'd trust each other more.Epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett don't soft-soap their message. It is brave to write a book arguing that economies should stop growing when millions of jobs are being lost, though they may be pushing at an open door in public consciousness. We know there is something wrong, and this book goes a long way towards explaining what and why.The authors point out that the life-diminishing results of valuing growth above equality in rich societies can be seen all around us. Inequality causes shorter, unhealthier and unhappier lives; it increases the rate of teenage pregnancy, violence, obesity, imprisonment and addiction; it destroys relationships between individuals born in the same society but into different classes; and its function as a driver of consumption depletes the planet's resources.Wilkinson, a public health researcher of 30 years' standing, has written numerous books and articles on the physical and mental effects of social differentiation. He and Pickett have compiled information from around 200 different sets of data, using reputable sources such as the United Nations, the World Bank, the World Health Organisation and the US Census, to form a bank of evidence against inequality that is impossible to deny.They use the information to create a series of scatter-graphs whose patterns look nearly identical, yet which document the prevalence of a vast range of social ills. On almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a gradient showing a strong correlation between a country's level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable \"low\" end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable \"high\" end, with Canada, Australasia and continental European countries in between.This has nothing to do with total wealth or even the average per-capita income. America is one of the world's richest nations, with among the highest figures for income per person, but has the lowest longevity of the developed nations, and a level of violence - murder, in particular - that is off the scale. Of all crimes, those involving violence are most closely related to high levels of inequality - within a country, within states and even within cities. For some, mainly young, men with no economic or educational route to achieving the high status and earnings required for full citizenship, the experience of daily life at the bottom of a steep social hierarchy is enraging.The graphs also reveal that it is not just the poor, but whole societies, from top to bottom, that are adversely affected by inequality. Although the UK fares badly when compared with most other OECD countries (and is the worst developed nation in which to be a child according to both Unicef and the Good Childhood Inquiry), its social problems are not as pronounced as in the US.Rates of illness are lower for English people of all classes than for Americans, but working-age Swedish men fare better still. Diabetes affects twice as many American as English people, whether they have a high or a low level of education. Wherever you look, evidence favouring greater equality piles up. As the authors write, \"the relationships between inequality and poor health and social problems are too strong to be attributable to chance\".But perhaps the most troubling aspect of reading this book is the revelation that the way we live in Britain is a serious danger to our mental health. Around a quarter of British people, and more than a quarter of Americans, experience mental problems in any given year, compared with fewer than 10 per cent in Japan, Germany, Sweden and Italy.Wilkinson and Pickett's description of unequal societies as \"dysfunctional\" suggests implicit criticism of the approach taken by Britain's \"happiness tsar\" Richard Layard, who recommended that the poor mental health of many Britons be \"fixed\" or improved by making cognitive behavioural therapy more easily available. Consumerism, isolation, alienation, social estrangement and anxiety all follow from inequality, they argue, and so cannot rightly be made a matter of individual management.There's an almost pleading quality to some of Wilkinson and Pickett's assertions, as though they feel they've spent their careers banging their heads against a brick wall. It's impossible to overstate the implications of their thesis: that the societies of Britain and the US have institutionalised economic and social inequality to the extent that, at any one time, a quarter of their respective populations are mentally ill. What kind of \"growth\" is that, other than a malignant one?One question that comes to mind is whether the world's most equal developed nations, Japan and Sweden, make sufficient allowance for individuals to express themselves without being regarded as a threat to the health of the collective. Critics of the two societies would argue that both make it intensely difficult for individual citizens to protest against the conformity both produced by, and required to sustain, equality. The inclination to dismiss or neuter individuals' complaints may, Wilkinson and Pickett suggest, go some way towards explaining the higher suicide rates in both countries compared with their more unequal counterparts. Those who feel wrong, or whose lives go wrong, may feel as though they really do have no one to blame but themselves.What Japan and Sweden do show is that equality is a matter of political will. There are belated signs - shown in the recent establishment of a National Equalities Panel and in Trevor Phil lips's public pronouncements on the central place of class in the landscape of British inequality - that Labour recognises that its relaxed attitude to people \"getting filthy rich\" has come back to bite it on the rear.Twelve years in power is long enough to reverse all the trends towards greater social and economic stratification that have occurred since 1970; instead they have continued on their merry way towards segregation. Teenage pregnancy rates have begun to rise after a period of decline; there is a 30-year gap in male life expectancy between central Glasgow and parts of southern England; and child poverty won't be halved by next year after all (though it wouldn't make as much difference as making their parents more equal).There are times when the book feels rather too overwhelmingly grim. Even if you allow for the fact that it was written before Barack Obama won the US presidency on a premise of trust and optimism, its opening pages are depressing enough to make you want to shut it fast: \"We find ourselves anxiety-ridden, prone to depression, driven to consume and with little or no community life.\" Taking the statistics broadly, they may be correct, but many readers simply won't feel like that.However, the book does end on an optimistic note, with a transformative, rather than revolutionary, programme for making sick societies more healthy. A society in which all citizens feel free to look each other in the eye can only come into being once those in the lower echelons feel more valued than at present. The authors argue that removal of economic impediments to feeling valued - such as low wages, low benefits and low public spending on education, for instance - will allow a flourishing of human potential.There is a growing inventory of serious, compellingly argued books detailing the social destruction wrought by inequality. Wilkinson and Pickett have produced a companion to recent bestsellers such as Oliver James's Affluenza and Alain de Botton's Status Anxiety . But The Spirit Level also contributes to a longer view, sitting alongside Richard Sennett's 2003 book Respect: The Formation of Character in an Age of Inequality , and the epidemiologist Michael Marmot's Status Syndrome , from 2005.Anyone who believes that society is the result of what we do, rather than who we are, should read these books; they should start with The Spirit Level because of its inarguable battery of evidence, and because its conclusion is simple: we do better when we're equal.

Photograph: John Moore/Getty ImagesTraces of daily apocalypse \u2026 US Border Patrol agents guard Mexican migrants in Arizona. Photograph: John Moore/Getty ImagesMaya JaggiWed 22 Apr 2015 20.01 AESTLast modified on Fri 23 Feb 2018 00.00 AEDTFrom its opening pages, when gaping asphalt swallows a man, a car, a\u00a0dog and \u201ceven the screams of passersby\u201d, this marvellously rich, slim novel is working on many levels. The lethal sinkhole is located in a generic silver-mining town in Mexico, \u201criddled with bullet holes and tunnels bored from five centuries of voracious silver lust\u201d. But the violent underworld it reveals is both mythological and dirty-real, a place of wandering souls and taciturn gangsters.Navigating this perilous terrain is Makina, a \u201csmart and schooled\u201d young woman who survives the sinkhole as she does every pitfall in the book, thinking of herself as \u201cthe door not the\u00a0one who walks through it\u201d. As\u00a0she notes laconically: \u201cThese things always happen to someone else until they happen to you.\u201d Sent by her mother to bring back her more gullible brother from across the US border, where he has been lured by the false hope of land from a long-absent father, she journeys from \u201cVillage\u201d to \u201cLittle Town\u201d to \u201cthe Big Chilango\u201d \u2013 Mexico City \u2013 and thence by bus to\u00a0the Rio Grande, crossing the roiling green river in an inner tube and running the desert gauntlet of people-smugglers, vigilantes and border patrols.In the Village, Makina runs the switchboard with the only phone for miles, speaking three languages \u2013 an Amerindian \u201cnative tongue\u201d, Spanish or \u201clatin tongue\u201d, and English, called \u201cnew tongue\u201d or \u201canglo\u201d. A medium between those who have \u201ccrossed\u201d to\u00a0the US and those left behind, she is\u00a0herself a messenger. In her journey across the border, she not only carries an appeal from her mother to her brother, but also a suspect package from the criminal underworld\u2019s Mr Aitch, a \u201creptile in pants\u201d who is an opportunistic drug lord \u2013 \u201cthe type who couldn\u2019t see a mule without wanting a\u00a0ride\u201d. In its maternally inspired quest, and its evocation of shifting borderlands between the living and the dead, the novel bows to Juan Rulfo\u2019s Pedro P\u00e1ramo, the Mexican ghost-town masterpiece that inspired Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. But while Rulfo charted the emptying of the countryside for the city, Herrera\u2019s lyric tale evokes the wave of migration from Mexico to the US also memorably explored by Carlos Fuentes in The Crystal Frontier.Herrera\u2019s great achievement lies in elevating the harsh epic of \u201ccrossing\u201d to the \u201cother side\u201d to soaring myth. There are allusions to Odysseus, Orpheus and\u00a0the Styx, the river of Greek mythology that was a border to\u00a0the Underworld; as well as Mesoamerican stories of shapeshifting and rebirth. Makina, who fords a Rio Grande \u201cfilled with invisible water monsters\u201d, is part superheroine. Rushing to her brother\u2019s aid, she almost flies, as she \u201cfelt her feet not touching the ground, as if she could float\u201d. She seems to repel bullets: one from a rancher\u2019s revolver enters her side but exits between two ribs. Yet her invincibility is grounded in a steely flair for handling herself in a macho world of oglers and predators, where men are defined by their weapons as \u201cThug .45\u201d or \u201cThug .38\u201d. One boy on the bus, with \u201cpeach fuzz and journey pride\u201d, falls to\u00a0his knees as she yanks back a finger of his groping hand. The desert bears traces of daily apocalypse, in discarded \u201crucksacks crammed with time. Amulets, letters, sometimes a huapango violin\u201d. A pregnant woman resting under a tree turns out to be a\u00a0\u201cpoor wretch swollen with putrefaction, his eyes and tongue pecked out by buzzards\u201d.Across the US border, a satirical eye is cast on supermarkets (\u201cIt\u2019s really lonely here, but there\u2019s lots of stuff\u201d) and baseball: \u201cOne of them whacks it, then sets off like it was a trip around the world, to every one of the bases out there, you know the anglos have bases all over the world, right?\u201d At times this feels schematic, yet a chilling climax contains emotional truths about the estrangement from their families of those who leave their homeland, and how many Latinos without papers are induced to join the US army as the price of becoming \u201clegal\u201d.Although this compelling heroine travels light, intent on \u201ccoming right back\u201d for her younger sister, the US has a\u00a0siren call. She is drawn to the \u201cintermediary tongue\u201d of her compatriots living in the north, which inhabits \u201ca nebulous territory between what is dying out and what is not yet born\u201d. Yet Herrera\u2019s metaphors grasp the freedom, and\u00a0the alarming disorientation, of transition and\u00a0translation. Faced with shedding her name, home and tongue, Makina whispers to herself, \u201cI\u2019ve been skinned.\u201dMakina carries a \u201clatin-anglo\u201d dictionary that frustrates her, being written \u201cby old men and for old men, outdated the second they left the press\u201d. Translator Lisa Dillman has found a\u00a0language both blunt and lyrical for Herrera\u2019s many neologisms, notably jarchas, a\u00a0verb he created from a Mozarabic noun meaning both \u201cexit\u201d and (in Arab\u00a0Andalusian verse) \u201cend couplet\u201d. Rendered as \u201cto verse\u201d, meaning to leave, this word, like the novel itself, \u201ccreates its own strange poetry.

Photograph: David Job/Getty ImagesMind mapped \u2026 Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow divides thought processes between System 1 and System 2. Photograph: David Job/Getty ImagesGalen StrawsonTue 13 Dec 2011 22.56 AEDTA human being \"is a dark and veiled thing; and whereas the hare has seven skins, the human being can shed seven times seventy skins and still not be able to say: This is really you, this is no longer outer shell.\" So said Nietzsche, and Freud agreed: we are ignorant of ourselves. The idea surged in the 20th century and became a commonplace, a \"whole climate of opinion\", in Auden's phrase.It's still a commonplace, but it's changing shape. It used to be thought that the things we didn't know about ourselves were dark \u2013 emotionally fetid, sexually charged. This was supposed to be why we were ignorant of them: we couldn't face them, so we repressed them. The deep explanation of our astonishing ability to be unaware of our true motives, and of what was really good for us, lay in our hidden hang-ups.These days, the bulk of the explanation is done by something else: the \"dual-process\" model of the brain. We now know that we apprehend the world in two radically opposed ways, employing two fundamentally different modes of thought: \"System 1\" and \"System 2\". System 1 is fast; it's intuitive, associative, metaphorical, automatic, impressionistic, and it can't be switched off. Its operations involve no sense of intentional control, but it's the \"secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make\" and it's the hero of Daniel Kahneman's alarming, intellectually aerobic book Thinking, Fast and Slow.System 2 is slow, deliberate, effortful. Its operations require attention. (To set it going now, ask yourself the question \"What is 13 x 27?\" And to see how it hogs attention, go to theinvisiblegorilla.com/videos.html and follow the instructions faithfully.) System 2 takes over, rather unwillingly, when things get difficult. It's \"the conscious being you call 'I'\", and one of Kahneman's main points is that this is a mistake. You're wrong to identify with System 2, for you are also and equally and profoundly System 1. Kahneman compares System 2 to a supporting character who believes herself to be the lead actor and often has little idea of what's going on.System 2 is slothful, and tires easily (a process called \"ego depletion\") \u2013 so it usually accepts what System 1 tells it. It's often right to do so, because System 1 is for the most part pretty good at what it does; it's highly sensitive to subtle environmental cues, signs of danger, and so on. It kept our remote ancestors alive. Syst\u00e8me 1 a ses raisons que Syst\u00e8me 2 ne conna\u00eet point, as Pascal might have said. It does, however, pay a high price for speed. It loves to simplify, to assume WYSIATI (\"what you see is all there is\"), even as it gossips and embroiders and confabulates. It's hopelessly bad at the kind of statistical thinking often required for good decisions, it jumps wildly to conclusions and it's subject to a fantastic suite of irrational biases and interference effects (the halo effect, the \"Florida effect\", framing effects, anchoring effects, the confirmation bias, outcome bias, hindsight bias, availability bias, the focusing illusion, and so on).The general point about the size of our self-ignorance extends beyond the details of Systems 1 and 2. We're astonishingly susceptible to being influenced \u2013 puppeted \u2013 by features of our surroundings in ways we don't suspect. One famous (pre-mobile phone) experiment centred on a New York City phone booth. Each time a person came out of the booth after having made a call, an accident was staged \u2013 someone dropped all her papers on the pavement. Sometimes a dime had been placed in the phone booth, sometimes not (a dime was then enough to make a call). If there was no dime in the phone booth, only 4% of the exiting callers helped to pick up the papers. If there was a dime, no fewer than 88% helped.Since then, thousands of other experiments have been conducted, right across the broad board of human life, all to the same general effect. We don't know who we are or what we're like, we don't know what we're really doing and we don't know why we're doing it. That's a System-1 exaggeration, for sure, but there's more truth in it than you can easily imagine. Judges think they make considered decisions about parole based strictly on the facts of the case. It turns out (to simplify only slightly) that it is their blood-sugar levels really sitting in judgment. If you hold a pencil between your teeth, forcing your mouth into the shape of a smile, you'll find a cartoon funnier than if you hold the pencil pointing forward, by pursing your lips round it in a frown-inducing way. And so it goes. One of the best books on this subject, a 2002 effort by the psychologist Timothy D Wilson, is appropriately called Strangers to Ourselves.We also hugely underestimate the role of chance in life (this is System 1's work). Analysis of the performance of fund managers over the longer term proves conclusively that you'd do just as well if you entrusted your financial decisions to a monkey throwing darts at a board. There is a tremendously powerful illusion that sustains managers in their belief their results, when good, are the result of skill; Kahneman explains how the illusion works. The fact remains that \"performance bonuses\" are awarded for luck, not skill. They might as well be handed out on the roll of a die: they're completely unjustified. This may be why some banks now speak of \"retention bonuses\" rather than performance bonuses, but the idea that retention bonuses are needed depends on the shared myth of skill, and since the myth is known to be a myth, the system is profoundly dishonest \u2013 unless the dart-throwing monkeys are going to be cut in.In an experiment designed to test the \"anchoring effect\", highly experienced judges were given a description of a shoplifting offence. They were then \"anchored\" to different numbers by being asked to roll a pair of dice that had been secretly loaded to produce only two totals \u2013 three or nine. Finally, they were asked whether the prison sentence for the shoplifting offence should be greater or fewer, in months, than the total showing on the dice. Normally the judges would have made extremely similar judgments, but those who had just rolled nine proposed an average of eight months while those who had rolled three proposed an average of only five months. All were unaware of the anchoring effect.The same goes for all of us, almost all the time. We think we're smart; we're confident we won't be unconsciously swayed by the high list price of a house. We're wrong. (Kahneman admits his own inability to counter some of these effects.) We're also hopelessly subject to the \"focusing illusion\", which can be conveyed in one sentence: \"Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you're thinking about it.\" Whatever we focus on, it bulges in the heat of our attention until we assume its role in our life as a whole is greater than it is. Another systematic error involves \"duration neglect\" and the \"peak-end rule\". Looking back on our experience of pain, we prefer a larger, longer amount to a shorter, smaller amount, just so long as the closing stages of the greater pain were easier to bear than the closing stages of the lesser one.Daniel Kahneman won a Nobel prize for economics in 2002 and he is, with Amos Tversky, one of a famous pair. For many in the humanities, their names are fused together, like Laurel and Hardy or Crick and Watson. Thinking, Fast and Slow has its roots in their joint work, and is dedicated to Tversky, who died in 1996. It is an outstanding book, distinguished by beauty and clarity of detail, precision of presentation and gentleness of manner. Its truths are open to all those whose System 2 is not completely defunct; I have hardly touched on its richness. Some chapters are more taxing than others, but all are gratefully short, and none requires any special learning.

An outspoken feminist and public intellectual, she has been castigated as a targowiczanin: an ancient term for a traitor. Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead \u2013 first published in 2009, and now arriving in a deft and sensitive English translation \u2013 provides an extraordinary display of the qualities that have made Tokarczuk so notable a presence in contemporary literature.When a victim is found with deerprints all around him, it seems entirely feasible that animals are committing murderThe novel is almost impossible to categorise. It is, in effect, a murder mystery: in the bleak Polish midwinter, men in an isolated village are being murdered, and it is left to Janina Duszejko, a kind of eastern European Miss Marple, to identify the murderer. But a mere whodunit would hardly satisfy a novelist who said \u201cjust writing a book to know who is the killer is wasting paper and time\u201d, and so it is also a primer on the politics of vegetarianism, a dark feminist comedy, an existentialist fable and a paean to William Blake.Janina tells us on the first page that she is \u201calready at an age and additionally in a state where I must always wash my feet thoroughly before bed, in the event of having to be removed by an ambulance in the Night\u201d. A bridge engineer turned schoolteacher, now reluctantly in retirement, she is devoted to Blake, and to studying astrological charts in order to make sense out of chaos. Her narrative voice gives the novel an instant propulsive charm: she exists, immediately, on the page \u2013 forthright, brilliant, funny, given to capitalising words in a fashion that recalls Tristram Shandy (\u201cI combine the Practical and the Sentimental\u201d). Deeply troubled about the world, her place in it and the hierarchy of humans among their fellow animals, she is often moved to dreadful melancholy, such as when she watches a pregnant woman reading a newspaper, and wonders: \u201cHow could one possibly know all this and not miscarry?\u201d\u2018A woman who combines an extraordinary intellect with an anarchic sensibility.\u2019 Olga Tokarczuk. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianShe is also chronically sick, with an illness that is never defined and seems to constitute an essential part of her character: but she entertains no self-pity, writing: \u201cSometimes I think that only the sick are truly healthy.\u201d She christens her friends and neighbours according to their nature \u2013 Big Foot, Oddball, Dizzy, Good News \u2013 and has an intense affinity for the local deer, whom she calls her \u201cyoung ladies\u201d. When Big Foot is found murdered, a shard of bone jammed down his throat, in the first of a spate of violent deaths, Janina believes that the key to the mystery lies in her village\u2019s love of hunting, both for sport and for meat. The reader wonders if the novel will take a turn towards magic realism: when a victim is found with deerprints hectically marking the snow all around him, it seems entirely feasible that, as Janina professes to believe, animals are committing murder. It is fitting that the spirit of Blake is so insistently present in the novel (the title is taken from his poem The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and each chapter is headed by a Blake quotation): he wrote that \u201call wholesome food is caught without a net or a trap\u201d, and would have shared the narrator\u2019s horror at the village\u2019s macho hunting culture.Though the book functions perfectly as noir crime \u2013 moving towards a denouement that, for sleight of hand and shock, should draw admiration from the most seasoned Christie devotee \u2013 its chief preoccupation is with unanswerable questions of free will versus determinism, and with existential unease. What, it asks, does it mean to be human, and what is it to be an animal, and what objective distinctions can be made between the two? Why is the killing of a deer mere sport, and the killing of a human murder? And if animal rights are elevated to those of human rights, would animals then be subject to criminal and human law \u2013 if an animal can be said to have been murdered, might it equally be charged with murder? What, moreover, are we for? Janina opens a kitchen drawer and looks at the \u201clong spoons, spatulas and strange hooks\u201d and thinks, in a moment of purest Sartre: \u201cI would really like to be one of those Utensils.\u201d She knows herself to be trapped \u2013 \u201cI cannot be someone other than I am. How awful\u201d \u2013 but refuses to be a dutiful prisoner of society and gender.Olga Tokarczuk: \u2018Reading Freud was my first step to becoming a writer\u2019Read moreIn Antonia Lloyd-Jones\u2019s translation, the prose is by turns witty and melancholy, and never slips out of that distinctive narrative voice. It also contains perhaps the most bravura translation performance I have ever seen, when Janina and her companion repeatedly attempt to translate a passage of Blake: several versions of a particular verse are rendered in English, which has been translated from the Polish, which in turn has been translated from English. It is difficult to imagine a more tricky task for a translator, or one undertaken with more skill.That this novel caused such a stir in Poland is no surprise. There, the political compass has swung violently to the right, and the rights of women and of animals are under attack (the novel\u2019s 2017 film adaptation, Spoor, caused one journalist to remark that it was \u201ca deeply anti-Christian film that promoted eco-terrorism\u201d). It is an astonishing amalgam of thriller, comedy and political treatise, written by a woman who combines an extraordinary intellect with an anarchic sensibility. Her subject is the entire \u201ccosmic Catastrophe that gave the world its being\u201d. As she asks: \u201cHow could we possibly understand it all?\u201d This article was amended on 5 April 2021. It is Big Foot who is first found murdered, not Oddball as stated in an earlier version. Sarah Perry\u2019s Melmoth is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail in October.

Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianAlex ClarkFri 28 Oct 2016 17.00 AEDTLast modified on Thu 22 Feb 2018 23.48 AEDTSebastian Barry\u2019s commitment to telling the stories of two Irish families, the Dunnes and the McNultys, over several novels and multiple time frames and locations, has led to one of the most compelling, bravura and heart-wrenching fictional projects of recent memory. Its gaps and fissures, its silences, its elaboration of attachment, separation and loss amount to a profound meditation on the nature of national identity, enforced emigration and the dispersal of a people into lands frequently inhospitable and alienating, there to forge a new life.Sebastian Barry: \u2018You get imprisoned in a kind of style, I could feel it leaning on me\u2019Read moreDays Without End, a fever dream of a novel that has much in common, particularly in terms of style, with Barry\u2019s prize-winning The Secret Scripture, presents us with Thomas McNulty, who has crossed the Atlantic to rebuild his life. The traumatic chaos of what he has left behind in Sligo \u2013 his family dead from famine, his country \u201cstarved in her stocking feet. And she had no stockings\u201d \u2013 is more than matched by the horrors that he encounters in a US in the grip of self-creation, its expansionist violence underwritten by its adherence to the notion of manifest destiny.It is the 1850s, and Thomas has arrived in Missouri by way of Quebec, a journey that is revealed only in snippets that lightly inflect the novel. His brief explanation of the aptitude he and those like him show for soldiery \u2013 \u201cHow we were able to see slaughter without flinching. Because we were nothing ourselves, to begin with\u201d \u2013 is later amplified by the nightmarish tale he hears from a fellow Irishman whose passage to the New World ends with corpses floating in the bilges, immured and abandoned. \u201cThat\u2019s why no one will talk,\u201d reflects Thomas, feeling that what has happened is simply not accounted as a subject. \u201cThat\u2019s because we were thought worthless. Nothing people. I guess that\u2019s what it was. That thinking just burns through your brain for a while. Nothing but scum.\u201dIn the US, Thomas is many things, as Barry\u2019s mobile, ambiguous characters frequently are. At the beginning, having teamed up with a boy named John Cole, he is a dancer, rigged out in women\u2019s clothing to entertain miners starved of female company; a so-called \u201cprairie fairy\u201d. But when the bloom of youth departs the pair at 17, they volunteer for the US Army and join the Oregon trail to California \u2013 \u201cweeks and weeks of riding and then turn left at some place I forget\u201d \u2013 to undertake a different kind of service. \u201cWe knew in our hearts our work was to be Indians,\u201d recalls Thomas; those who now regard themselves as the rightful occupants of the south-west want rid of them, at a price of two dollars a scalp.A brutal raid on an Indian settlement follows, its description made remarkable by Barry\u2019s trademark blend of forceful clarity and otherworldliness, his ability to scent the mundane in the apocalyptic and vice versa. In a passage that calls to mind one of The Secret Scripture\u2019s most vivid and defining scenes \u2013 that of an orphanage on fire \u2013 the transformative effect of such destruction on its participants is memorably captured: \u201cMore sparks flew up, it was a complete vision of world\u2019s end and death, in those moments I could think no more, my head bloodless, empty, racketing, astonished \u2026 We were dislocated, we were not there, now we were ghosts.\u201d The earlier book also resurfaces via the image of rats, here pictured as swarming emblems of the will to survive, \u201cdozens of the critters swimming for their lives\u201d.But Barry\u2019s business extends beyond intense and visceral description, though that persists through a narrative that eventually encompasses the American civil war as well as increasingly complex interactions with indigenous communities. It also captures the development of Thomas and John\u2019s relationship, the men\u2019s sexual attraction to one another announced early in the novel by the simple, paragraph-long sentence: \u201cAnd then we quietly fucked and then we slept.\u201d What makes this strand of storyline unexpected is that it ushers in an exploration of gender fluidity and a redefinition of family that seems to scream anachronism but is nonetheless convincing.That Thomas \u2013 or, albeit briefly and in clandestine fashion, Thomasina \u2013 dons a frock and marries John would test a literal reading; that they also act as parents to a Sioux child, Winona, who has been wrested from her family in an altogether more realistic plot development, is equally hard to credit. But it is of a piece with Barry\u2019s abiding preoccupation \u2013 near obsession \u2013 throughout the McNulty sequence with rupture and remaking. It is as if he is saying: if you can believe in a country laid waste for the want of its most basic crop, or a continent of persons displaced by frontier-lust, then why wouldn\u2019t you believe this?The willingness to suspend disbelief is everywhere under pressure, and juxtaposed with Barry\u2019s determination to face history. A group of Oglala Sioux stalk Thomas\u2019s company for miles across the Missouri Breaks, terrifying them and then shocking them with a sudden display of compassionate hospitality; but a brief period of co\u2011existence yields to more bloodshed, to raped women and children snatched or left dead. In the years immediately before the civil war, America is shown as a country defined by lawlessness, ambition and plasticity; afterwards, it seems more hopelessly fractured, haunted by what has befallen it. During one of the many journeys the characters make across state lines, Thomas, John and Winona meet a Shawnee Indian, impoverished and fishing for mussels. He is unable to speak to Winona because they don\u2019t share a common language; they are both not where they are supposed to be. Thomas summarises the mournful occasion accurately: \u201cJust an old widower Indian man by a river whose name we didn\u2019t know.\u201dThis McNulty adventure is experimental and breathtakingly excitingThe image of a country populated by spectral figures, devastated by conflicts that leave men \u201cmaking the noises of ill-butchered cattle\u201d, their limbs hanging by a thread, their bodies emaciated and withered, is in sharp contrast with the landscape that inspires awe in both Thomas and Barry, and which seems to demand an equal grandeur in the observer: \u201cA vicious ruined class of man could cry at such scenes because it seems to tell him that his life is not approved.\u201dNumerous other questions of identity flit through the novel. The emigrant Thomas rarely sounds exactly Irish, though the odd word bubbles up: \u201chames\u201d, as in making a hames, or a mess, of something, or \u201cfrocken\u201d, a small berry found on Irish mountainsides, gathered up and sold for dye. He is ambivalent about his compatriots, at the least, but his ambivalence itself centres on duality: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me a Irish is an example of civilised humanity. He may be an angel in the clothes of a devil or a devil in the clothes of an angel but either way you\u2019re talking to two when you talk to one Irishman.\u201dThomas\u2019s journey towards womanhood is equally alive to the idea of multitude, as what could be seen as his femininity \u2013 largely his desire to dress as a woman and his maternal feelings for Winona \u2013 is set apart from his stereotypically masculine capacity for war, in part derived from his sense of loyalty to his fellow soldiers. His striking description of a brutal reprisal against an Indian incursion presents an image of entrancement, of near dissociation: \u201cWe work in our lather of strange sorrow, but utterly revengeful, fiercely so, soldiers of intentful termination, of total annihilation.\u201dDays Without End is a work of staggering openness; its startlingly beautiful sentences are so capacious that they are hard to leave behind, its narrative so propulsive that you must move on. In its pages, Barry conjures a world in miniature, inward, quiet, sacred; and a world of spaces and borders so distant they can barely be imagined. Taken as a whole, his McNulty adventure is experimental, self-renewing, breathtakingly exciting. It is probably not ended yet. Days Without End is published by Faber.

The government's main mouthpiece, the Korean Central News Agency, has a firm policy of reporting almost no news. True, tourists can visit the showcase capital, Pyongyang, for a few days and enjoy some pleasant chat with their affable but carefully selected minders, but they will gain few insights into what makes the country tick and they will have no opportunity to speak to anyone who could be remotely regarded as an ordinary North Korean. As the British ambassador put it with devastating frankness last year, \"We get no information from the government whatsoever\", and there are few sources of information in Pyongyang to turn to who are not government officials.So to find out what North Koreans think about their government and society, one has no choice but to talk to defectors who have managed to escape to South Korea. Los Angeles Times journalist Barbara Demick interviewed about 100 defectors, but in this highly readable book she focuses on half a dozen, all from the north-eastern city of Chongjin , which is closed to foreigners. She decided to concentrate on Chongjin because it is likely to be more representative than Pyongyang, where, for all its drabness and endless power shortages, nobody is starving. The overwhelming impression one gains from the book is of a country mired in poverty and repression, but also of resilience and a will to survive.North Korean children are taught to sing that \"We have nothing to envy in the world\", and until recently people seem to have believed this as they had so little access to information about life outside their own country. But the famine of the 1990s, in which more than a million people might have died, inevitably resulted in a deep questioning and cynicism. \"Your general [the demigod Kim Jong-il] has turned you all into idiots,\" Oak-hee tells her mother after being released from jail for crossing the border into China.Oak-hee had watched South Korean television, which made it clear that what they were told back home about exploitation and poverty in the capitalist south was all lies. By now, many officials no longer believe in the government propaganda either, and a prison director tells the women held for escaping to China, \"Well, if you go to China again, next time don't get caught.\"But despite such comments, the book does not argue that the regime is about to collapse, as many defectors and western commentators in the 1990s expected that it would.One of the most poignant stories in the book is that of two young lovers who dare not tell each other that they are thinking of defecting. Mi-ran is from near the bottom of the North Korean social heap, while Jun-sang comes from a comparatively privileged family, with relatives in Japan. Eventually they meet up again in South Korea, but their relationship is over. Mi-ran is happily married to a southerner but is haunted by the fate of her sisters, who are either in a labour camp or dead, while Jun-sang, who attended an elite Pyongyang university, is facing an uncertain future and worries that he will never see his parents again.Demick says defectors find it hard to settle in South Korea and are overwhelmed by the myriad choices facing them there, which \"can be utterly paralysing for people who've had decisions made for them by the state their entire lives\". Surprisingly perhaps, \"Many if not most, want to return to North Korea,\" Demick claims, and are wracked by guilt over leaving family members there.But defectors are, by definition, not typical: they are likely to be more disaffected, more resourceful and richer than the average citizen, so this book is hardly the definitive account of everyday life in North Korea. Yet the stories it recounts are moving and disturbing, and it surely tells us far more about real North Korean lives than a fleeting tourist visit to the Stalinist-kitsch theme park that is Pyongyang.Michael Rank is a former Reuters correspondent in Beijing.

Photograph: Olivia Harris/Getty ImagesJames BridleSat 2 Feb 2019 18.30 AEDTLast modified on Sat 2 Feb 2019 20.42 AEDTThe alarm beside your bed rings, triggered by an event in your calendar. The smart thermostat in your bedroom, sensing your motion, turns on the hot water and reports your movements to a central database. News updates ping your phone, with your daily decision whether to click on them or not carefully monitored, and parameters adjusted accordingly. How far and where your morning run takes you, the conditions of your commute, the contents of your text messages, the words you speak in your own home and your actions beneath all-seeing cameras, the contents of your shopping basket, your impulse purchases, your speculative searches and choices of dates and mates \u2013 all recorded, rendered as data, processed, analysed, bought, bundled and resold like sub-prime mortgages. The litany of appropriated experiences is repeated so often and so extensively that we become numb, forgetting that this is not some dystopian imagining of the future, but the present.While insisting their technology is too complex to be legislated, companies spend billions lobbying against oversightOriginally intent on organising all human knowledge, Google ended up controlling all access to it; we do the searching, and are searched in turn. Setting out merely to connect us, Facebook found itself in possession of our deepest secrets. And in seeking to survive commercially beyond their initial goals, these companies realised they were sitting on a new kind of asset: our \u201cbehavioural surplus\u201d, the totality of information about our every thought, word and deed, which could be traded for profit in new markets based on predicting our every need \u2013 or producing it. In a move of such audacity that it bears comparison to the enclosure of the commons or colonial conquests, the tech giants unilaterally declared that these previously untapped resources were theirs for the taking, and brushed aside every objection. While insisting that their technology is too complex to be legislated, there are companies that have poured billions into lobbying against oversight, and while building empires on publicly funded data and the details of our private lives they have repeatedly rejected established norms of societal responsibility and accountability. And what is crucially different about this new form of exploitation and exceptionalism is that beyond merely strip-mining our intimate inner lives, it seeks to shape, direct and control them. Their operations transpose the total control over production pioneered by industrial capitalism to every aspect of everyday life.The extraction is so grotesque, so creepy, that it is almost impossible to see how anyone who really thinks about it lives with it \u2013 and yet we do. There\u2019s something about its opacity, its insidiousness, that makes it hard to think about, just as it\u2019s hard to think about climate change, a process that will inevitably undo society as we currently understand it, yet is experienced by many of us as slightly better weather. Likewise the benefits of faster search results and turn-by-turn directions mask the deeper, destructive predations of what Shoshana Zuboff terms \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d, a force that is as profoundly undemocratic as it is exploitative, yet remains poorly understood. As she details in her important new book, ignorance of its operation is one of the central strategies of this regime, and yet the tide is turning: more and more people express their unease about the surveillance economy and, disturbed by the fractious, alienated and trustless social sphere it generates, are seeking alternatives. It will be a long, slow and difficult process to extricate ourselves from the toxic products of both industrial and surveillance capitalism, but its cause is assisted by the weighty analysis provided by books such as this. Combining in-depth technical understanding and a broad, humanistic scope, Zuboff has written what may prove to be the first definitive account of the economic \u2013 and thus social and political \u2013 condition of our age.Zuboff is no stranger to this territory. In her 1988 book In the Age of the Smart Machine, she addressed at the moment of their appearance in the business world many of the issues that have come to achieve dominance in our everyday life. Embedded within a large pharmaceutical company in the 1980s, she observed first-hand how new tools for internal communication, first welcomed by employees as novel social spaces in which they could better converse, plan and access information, were gradually recognised as tools for management intrusion and control. Aspects of employees\u2019 personal experience that were implicit and private suddenly became explicit and public, were exposed to scrutiny and made the basis for evaluation, criticism and punishment. Now it is the interiors of all our lives that are exposed to invisible overseers, who do not merely profit from our actions, but increasingly control their every expression.Players think they are playing one game \u2013 collecting Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 while they are in fact pawns in an entirely different oneConsider the apparently benign game Pok\u00e9mon Go, both a ridiculous and a transparent example of the link between behavioural surplus and physical control. While its initial players lauded the game for its incitement to head outside into the \u201creal world\u201d, they in fact stumbled straight into an entirely fabricated reality, one based on years of conditioning human motivation through reward systems, and designed to herd its users towards commercial opportunities. Within days of the game\u2019s launch in 2016, its creators revealed that attractive virtual locations were for sale to the highest bidder, inking profitable deals with McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks and others to direct Pok\u00e9mon hunters to their front doors. The players think they are playing one game \u2013 collecting Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 while they are in fact playing an entirely different one, in which the board is invisible but they are the pawns. And Pok\u00e9mon Go is but one tiny probe extending out from Google and others\u2019 vast capabilities to tune and manipulate human action at scale: a global means of behaviour modification entirely owned and operated by private enterprise.The efficacy of Pok\u00e9mon Go in impelling and directing human behaviour recalls nothing so strongly as the psychologist BF Skinner\u2019s development of operant conditioning, and Skinner is one of many figures Zuboff evokes, implicates and critiques in her narrative. Skinner developed and perfected a technology of behaviour modification in living organisms, and extrapolated from it a politics rooted in total social control. Published in 1971, his incendiary treatise Beyond Freedom and Dignity prescribed a future of behavioural modification and redirection which rejected the very idea of freedom, replacing it with guaranteed outcomes and individual conformity. But while the targets of operant conditioning in the 20th century were always construed as \u201cthem\u201d \u2013 enemies, prisoners and social misfits \u2013 and its implications were the subject of revulsion and rejection by a public fearful of \u201cmind control\u201d, the targets of the same logic today are all of us, and its possibilities have been embraced at the highest level, from the boardrooms of the most powerful corporations to governments seeking to both \u201cnudge\u201d their populations towards \u201cbetter\u201d decisions, and to surveil their inner moods and desires for any signs of deviance, dissent or radical intent.Go with the crowd \u2026 people play Pok\u00e9mon Go at Yokohama Stadium in Japan. Photograph: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty ImagesFor Zuboff, this dread force is not merely a higher expression of capitalism, but a perversion of it, and while some might regard that as special pleading, she is at pains to clarify where it differs from more equitable and mutually beneficial forms. As a consequence of placing her analysis within economic theory and a wider history of both capitalism and totalitarianism, she introduces a number of useful terms into the discussion which do much to move it forward. Much of the debate around Google, Facebook and their ilk, for example, has been framed in terms of privacy \u2013 as mere control over information about the self \u2013 and while many of these arguments are venerable and well-articulated, they\u2019ve also been mostly lost. It seems people are very willing to give up their private information in return for perceived benefits such as ease of use, navigation and access to friends and information. Zuboff recasts the conversation around privacy as one over \u201cdecision rights\u201d: the agency we can actively assert over our own futures, which is fundamentally usurped by predictive, data-driven systems. Engaging with the systems of surveillance capitalism, and acquiescing to its demands for ever deeper incursions into everyday life, involves much more than the surrender of information: it is to place the entire track of one\u2019s life, the determination of ones path, under the purview and control of the market, just as Pok\u00e9mon Go players are walked, lit by their glowing screens, straight through the doors of shops they didn\u2019t even know they wanted to visit.When this logic of invisible coercion is applied to the social sphere, its implications become even more disturbing. The belief that human behaviour can be perfectly modelled, predicted and controlled entrains as a consequence the collapse of equitable relations between individuals and trust in institutions, and the substitution of algorithmic certainty for any semblance of participatory, democratic society. There is no appeal to collective, contestable decision-making or to responsible business practices under this purported perfection of human behaviour. Surveillance capitalism, run as the code for everyday life, erases both free will and free markets \u2013 an outcome as horrifying to confirmed believers in \u201cgood old\u201d capitalism, such as Zuboff, as to those of us who weren\u2019t so sure about the original in the first place.What is hinted at throughout the text, and made explicit in Zuboff\u2019s closing insistence that subsequent generations must face up to this epochal challenge to the future, is that such utopian schemes are destined to fail. As experience has shown, the world \u2013 life itself \u2013 is cloudy, contingent and defined by change. As horrifying as the surveillance capitalists\u2019 view of a totally controlled, perfectly articulated and error-free future might be, the inevitable failure of its vision, and the resultant violence \u2013 already evident in our fractured worldviews, competing fundamentalisms, weakening of social bonds, and distrust of one another \u2013 is perhaps more so. The work begins in demolishing the framework of this world order, but it continues in the establishment and enactment of new and better futures.

Weak? Unhappy? Heartless? It's a question that nags away at the deserted kid. Was Dad really an out-and-out shit? Perhaps he just wasn't ready for responsibility. Perhaps Mum drove him away. Perhaps he thought everyone would be better off without him. Perhaps...Chris Ware knew the question, but only part of the answer. His father disappeared for 30 years, blipped back into his life with a few phone calls and one uneasy dinner, then stood him up at what would have been their second meeting. Before he could get in touch again - assuming that was even in his mind - he died of a heart attack. As Ware notes here in his postscript, the four or five hours the book takes to read \"is almost exactly the total time I ever spent with my father, either in person or on the phone\". During the first, 30-year separation, Ware began to work out his anger and longing in a weekly comic strip, now brought together as a beautifully produced hardback. Two interleaved narratives, separated by convoluted dream sequences and forbiddingly detailed plans for cut-and-fold paper toys, depict the awkward meeting between a thirtysomething loser and the father he has never known; and, more than 80 years before, the abandonment of the father's own father by his father. The stories are simply drawn, without the gothic shadows and mad clutter of so many graphic novels, but the multiple timelines and digressions twist and slot together to form a structure as complex and improbable as any of Ware's paper toys \"for the friendless, the weak of heart and the ignored\". The Jimmy of the title is a prematurely aged office dogsbody, blowing around Chicago with only fantasies to keep him company. He is shrunken in on himself, round-shouldered and hunched as if to present the smallest possible target. He has tiny, droopy eyes, never meets a gaze, has no small talk or social graces. The only person who even tries to connect with him is his mother, and Jimmy finds her such a burden that he buys an answering machine to keep her at bay. Jimmy has no memories of the man whose name he bears, and when one day the mail brings an invitation to spend Thanksgiving with him, his head is filled with hope, hate and fear. But what he finds in Michigan is neither a saint nor a devil, nor even a consistently inadequate parent. His father has brought up another child - and pretty well, to judge by the \"Number 1 Dad\" T-shirts she buys him. He can be unthinking and dull, but who can't? And he wants to make amends. He says it not with flowers, but with bacon: four strips of 100% US grade-A Country Morn that spell out the word \"HI\" on Jimmy's breakfast plate. Gradually Ware shifts the focus to Jimmy's grandfather James, one of those desiccated old men who are too stubborn to die. He's grouchy, insensitive, vaguely racist. But by the time we know him as an adult, we have met him as a child and it's impossible to despise him. Little James's mother dies in childbirth, he makes enemies like most children make friends, and to his strap-happy father he is a \"goddamn little son of a bitch\". One day James and his father visit the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, climbing to an observation platform above one of the great halls. As the world stretches out below, the father mutters something and just walks away, never to be seen again. \"He'd told me dozens of times that he didn't want me around, and that he'd never asked for a child in the first place,\" James later recalls. Jimmy's suffering and his father's delinquency suddenly shrink in scale. This is a finely crafted, complex book that gets better with every chapter: Ware seems to have matured both as an artist and a person in the years it took to complete. While so many similar projects are little more than strings of striking images, Jimmy Corrigan forces you to pause, flick back a few pages and read again, rewarding you with another insight, another overdue connection. It is a rare and uplifting example of an artistic vision pushed to the limits.TopicsBiography booksHigher educationChris WarereviewsReuse this contentEducationSchoolsTeachersUniversitiesStudentsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

As its title and first pages suggest, its surface plot concerns a tabloid-pleasing sizzler of a scandal. Sheba Hart, a 41-year-old pottery teacher, arrives at a dreggy north London comp trailing the kind of tarnished glamour that sets the school's sex-starved males mildly abuzz. The suitor who presses his case first is 15-year-old Steven Connolly, a reasonably gormless lad with mild artistic proclivities, a cabbie father, and a home on an estate. Within months of her arrival, Sheba, a mother of two and the apparently contented wife of a lecturer 20 years her senior, is copulating with the grammatically challenged adolescent on the art-room floor. So far, so dubiously titillating. Except it's not. Neither player tells the story in their own words, so instead of the anticipated wallow in dodgy Nabokovian delights, we're given a third party's somewhat matter-of-fact account of the charmless youth's entanglement with the unlikely school sexpot. Notes on a Scandal is therefore neither an essay in praise of older women, nor a Death in Venice-like reverie on the exquisite properties of the young male. We're held at one emotional remove throughout by the novel's narrator, and immediately told how the affair ends, effectively puncturing all potential for thrilling tension. The novel is narrated by Barbara Covett, the self-appointed chronicler of Sheba's affair, whose alarming zeal when undertaking her task includes the use of gold stars to highlight seminal events and a timeline on graph paper. Nudging retirement age, Barbara, a colleague and friend of Sheba's, is a childless spinster who has taught history for several decades and lives in Archway with her cat. Barbara does not belong to the Nick Carraway school of narrators, and at first her attempt to codify the passions of others is clunkingly intrusive. But her voice as a \"caretaker... defending the character of an alleged child-molester\" insidiously takes over: the disturbing undercurrent that is Barbara's psyche wells up and drives the book more powerfully than the perfunctory little tale of underage sex that frames it. \"This is not a story about me,\" she says. But of course it is. As Sheba trips with barely a twinge of turmoil into a life of Hampstead Heath sex sessions, scuffles by the kiln and full-blown symptoms of infatuation (while simultaneously shepherding the other rebellious teen in her life, her 17-year-old daughter), guard dog Barbara is both slavering and snapping in the background as her fixation with Sheba takes on stalkerish hues. Painfully class-conscious, embittered and obsessive, she trails a history of social rejection that only stokes her determination to lap up every fragment of Sheba's full life. It is hard to decide whether her impulses stem from suppressed Sapphism, maternal frustration, or out-and-out lunacy. Eventually, all that simmering love-hatred leads to staggering betrayal and tabloid indignation. This is a fascinating, brilliant, irritating novel, consistently defying definition by genre, literary worth, or even purpose. It's a quiet little read - yet horribly addictive. Underlying breathtakingly acute observations, and much fine writing, there's a lightness of sentiment that sporadically propels the novel into the realms of commercial pap. The main question that springs to mind is - why? Heller is a fine writer, fashioning her material with supreme confidence: the novel is funny, bleak, superbly structured, and full of the satisfyingly tight phrases that distinguish her journalism, but the fundamental point is somehow elusive. As her first novel, Everything You Know, showed, pathologically flawed protagonists are her fort\u00e9, and the distortions of the unreliable narrator are intriguing; but Heller, for all her cold-eyed brilliance and psychological insights, has still to find her subject - has still to dig her pen deeper into everyday emotion. Her description of \"the drip drip of long-haul, no-end-in-sight solitude\" is hauntingly moving: about to visit the strangely dated Sheba (purple shoes, tendrils of hair and other 1970s accoutrements), poor Barbara can live \"on a crumb of anticipation for weeks at a time, but always in danger of crushing the waited-for event with the freight of my excessive hope\". Sheba steadily and hilariously regresses, resorting to disguised teenage voices and late-night crouching beneath Connolly's bedroom, complete with its Grand Prix bedspread. By the end, in one glorious inversion, Barbara has become mother to the middle-aged \"celebrity deviant\", who now naps on a princess bed and eats nursery food. Truly tragicomic, this flimsy tale, this little psychological masterpiece, continues to disturb long after its last page.\u00b7\nJoanna Briscoe is the author of Skin (Phoenix).

A chance encounter, a sudden death, love at first sight, an overheard conversation, all belong, we imagine, not to a tightly plotted thriller but to the erratic jottings of a distracted dreamer. A woman might notice a couple meeting every day in the same cafe, discover later that the man has been stabbed to death by a demented beggar, and decide to speak to the widow the next time she sees her. Each of these events seems whimsical and arbitrary and yet, as Javier Mar\u00edas shows in this masterly novel, chance is nothing but the result of our own negligent reading. Read in the proper order, from the first to the last chapter, everything we do and everything we witness, however unlikely or disconnected, fits into a story in which we are both narrators and protagonists.Such is the case of Mar\u00eda Dolz, a middle-aged woman who works for a Madrid publisher, who witnesses the couple's meetings, and then their absence; who discovers in the papers the murder of the husband, a certain Miguel Desverne; and who seeks out the widow, Luisa Alday, to offer her condolences. As it happens, Dolz meets Alday's new companion, a handsome man called D\u00edaz Varela, who was Desverne's best friend. Dolz becomes infatuated with D\u00edaz Varela and, shortly afterwards, they begin an intermittent sexual relationship.\"Infatuations\" is the only possible English translation for the \"enamoramientos\" of the original title. Margaret Jull Costa, with her habitual skill, has rendered Mar\u00edas's precise, somewhat laconic Spanish into graceful and equally laconic English, but the title necessarily defeats her. \"Enamoramiento\" is the act of falling in love, briefly but not less passionately; \"infatuation\" (the dictionary tells us) is\u00a0to become inspired with intense fondness, admiration, even folly; unfortunately, in the English term, love is absent. As Dolz's lovely last words have it, after the end of an \"enamoramiento\" we continue to sense the loved one's presence, \"knowing that he is still on our horizon, from which he has not entirely vanished, and that we cannot see, in the distance, the dust from his fleeting feet\".Dolz's narrative is studded with questions: What is her new lover's involvement with the widow? What are his true feelings towards both women? Did he have a hand in the husband's murder? And above all, what is her own role in the convoluted plot into which she seems to have fallen? Who, in fact, is she?The classical themes of love, death and fate are explored with elegant intelligence by Mar\u00edas in what is perhaps his best novel so far. The story's literary underpinnings are Macbeth (as is usual in Mar\u00edas), Balzac's Colonel Chabert and, more surprisingly, Dumas's The Three Musketeers, all glossed by D\u00edaz Varela, who paternalistically instructs Dolz on the importance these three books have for him. Central to Mar\u00edas's novel is Balzac's colonel, a man supposed dead who returns among the living, much like the dead Desverne returns to haunt the minds of the survivors. Over this literary chorus echoes a grisly observation quoted by D\u00edaz Varela from the Musketeer saga: \"A murder, nothing more.\" For Dolz, the banality of murder implied in Dumas's words becomes translated as murder's monstrous immutability. \"A thief can give back the\u00a0thing he stole, a slanderer can acknowledge his calumny,\" Dolz thinks to herself. \"The trouble with murder is that it's always too late and you cannot restore to the world the person you killed.\" She adds: \"And if, as they say, there is no forgiveness, then, whenever necessary, you must continue along the road taken.\" Except that, eventually, the murderer will no longer think of his crime \"as a monstrous exception or a tragic mistake, but, rather, as another resource that life offers to the boldest and toughest.\" He will feel as if he has simply inherited the terrible action, or won it at a raffle \"from which no one is exempt\". And this feeling will lead him to believe \"that he didn't wholly commit those acts, or not at least alone\". In these extraordinary words, Mar\u00edas has defined the ethos of our time.Mar\u00edas is an old hand at hoodwinking the reader, layering his novels with plots that seem, each one, final, but then suddenly blossom into something unexpected. In The Infatuations, Mar\u00edas may have been thinking of Macbeth's address to the witches: \"If you can look into the seeds of time,/ And say which grain will grow and which will not,/ Speak then to me.\" Neither the reader\u00a0nor the protagonists are capable of such foresight, but the clear knowledge that every event, however minuscule, might develop into a sprawling web of roots and branches, lends every detail in the novel (as it does in detective fiction) a possibly dangerous meaning. Over the events in the The Infatuations, this other, untold and latent story casts an ominous and uneasy shadow.\"Once you've finished a novel,\" says D\u00edaz Varela to Dolz, \"what happened in\u00a0it is of little importance and soon forgotten. What matters are the possibilities and ideas that the novel's imaginary plot communicates to us and infuses us with, a plot that we recall far more vividly than real events and to which we pay far more attention.\"TopicsFictionreviewsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

DeLillo's Underworld has been the most influential American novel of the last 15 years. Underworld might fairly have been called The Connections. It seeks to represent the interconnectedness of American society by picturing it as a web threaded on strings of paranoia and power - a kind of Bleak House of the digital age. It combined an old-fashioned solidity and social realism with the prospect of the American writer as a cool cultural theorist, writing riffs and knowing essaylets about the power of the image in American society, about TV, crowds, garbage, the military-industrial complex and so on. But there was a problem with DeLillo's example. His novel was a Dickensian novel without any humans in it. DeLillo insisted on connections (the atom bomb is somehow connected to JFK's assassination and to paranoia) as Dickens's plots insist on connections (wills, lost relatives, distant benefactors). But in Underworld there are no connections at the human level at all, because there are no human beings in the novel, no one who really matters and whose consciousness matters to himself. Franzen realised something like this when he read Underworld, and pledged to put the matter right by producing, in his novel The Corrections, a book of DeLillo-like breadth and intellectual critique which was centred on human beings. He proposed, in effect, a softened DeLilloism. So The Corrections is itself a correction, and as such it succeeds marvellously. At its centre is the Lambert family, dominated by Alfred, the difficult patriarch, and Enid, the yearning and frustrated matriarch. Three grown-up children, Gary, Chip and Denise, labour to live adult lives under the long shadow cast by their unhappy parents. Around this tale of family life, Franzen deploys a lot of social life: we learn about a sinister biotech company in Philadelphia, a big midwestern railroad company, a liberal arts college in Connecticut and the pharmaceutical culture. Franzen's emphasis on the human is welcome, and doubtless explains the novel's enormous popularity in America (where it has been a bestseller since it appeared in September). Franzen is a very intelligent, very appealing writer; so much so that an essentially dark book stays in the memory as warm and comic. To call it Tolstoyan seems exaggerated, however. The novelist Michael Cunning ham likens it to Buddenbrooks, but a comparison of those two novels shows The Corrections to be wide rather than deep, and smart rather than subtle. It has some of Mann's sweep and some of his gentle comedy (and even some of his Schopenhauer); but it lacks the luminous control of that great German book. Indeed, The Corrections suffers from a desire to put too much in. His novel is a kind of glass-bottomed boat through which one can glimpse most of the various currents of contemporary American fiction: domestic realism; postmodern cultural riffing; campus farce; \"smart young man's irony\" of the kind familiar in Rick Moody and David Foster Wallace; and, rather too often, an easy journalism of style. But the book is frequently distinguished and challenging, and it was thus a surprise when Oprah Winfrey, not previously known for her taste in big postmodern novels, chose it for her televisual \"book club\". Franzen naturally accepted her invitation - such a decision commonly means royalties in the millions of dollars - and then complained to journalists that he felt he was being controlled and manipulated by Winfrey. Nervously, he explained that he felt that his book belonged to a \"high art\" literary tradition, while many of the Winfrey choices were sentimental and trashy. Winfrey then rescinded her invitation to feature Franzen on her show. Franzen was soon being pummelled all over America for his \"ingratitude\". He had committed perhaps the worst American sin, elitism; and the second worst American sin, a lack of proper respect for the forces of commerce. He duly apologised for claiming his book as high art, and told newspapers that he and Winfrey were actually united in the great joint jihad of eliminating distinctions between high and low novels. The media beast, duly mollified, moved on to anthrax. But one sympathised with Franzen's dilemma. Indeed, the sight of a novelist acting in this rebellious, stubborn, difficult, old-fashioned manner was cheering. Franzen was right to identify commercial forces such as Winfrey for what they are - forces that may actually be antithetical to literature, for all that they come dressed as literature's helpmeet. Winfrey's \"book club\", after all, has made a great contribution to American literacy, but has very little to do with American literature. And one sympathised with Franzen's own literary status - anxiety; his novel may not be Tolstoy, but it does indeed belong to high literature. Franzen may himself be a little confused on this score. Five years ago, he wrote: \"I resist the notion of literature as a noble calling because elitism doesn't sit well with my American nature, and because... my belief in manners would make it difficult for me to explain to my brother, who is a fan of Michael Crichton, that the work I'm doing is simply better than Crichton's.\" Eh? Franzen doesn't want to tell his brother that he is better than Crichton, for fear of offence; but he is sure he is better than Crichton anyway! Such is the modern, populist anxiety of a serious, talented, highbrow writer - an anxiety now made infinitely more acute by wild commercial success.TopicsBooksFictionJonathan FranzenThe CorrectionsreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The women are not entirely silent, and goddesses always have plenty to say, but mortal women speak primarily to lament. They grieve for their dead sons, dead fathers, dead husbands and dead protectors; for the city of Troy, soon to fall, and for their own freedom, taken by the victors of war. Andromache pleads with her Trojan husband Hector not to leave her and their infant son to go back to fight Achilles. She has already endured the sack of her home city by Achilles, and seen the slaughter of her father and seven brothers, and the enslavement of her mother. If Hector dies, their child will be hurled from the city walls, Troy will fall and Andromache will be made the concubine of the son of her husband\u2019s killer. Hector knows this, but he insists that his own need to avoid social humiliation as a battle-shirker trumps it all: \u201cI would be ashamed before the Trojan men and women,\u201d he says. He hopes only to be dead before he has to hear her screams.Pat Barker\u2019s brilliant new novelistic retelling of The Iliad puts the experience of women like Andromache at the heart of the story: the women who survive in slavery when men destroy their cities and kill their fathers, brothers and children. The central character is Briseis, the woman awarded to Achilles, the greatest Greek fighter, after his army sacks one of the towns\u00a0neighbouring Troy. Agamemnon, the most powerful, although not the bravest, of the Greek warriors \u2013 a character whose downright nastiness comes across beautifully in Barker\u2019s telling \u2013 has lost\u00a0his own most\u00a0recent female acquisition and seizes Briseis from Achilles. Achilles\u2019 vengeful rage against Agamemnon and his own comrades, and the\u00a0subsequent vast death toll of the\u00a0Greeks and Trojans, is the central theme of The\u00a0Iliad.Homer\u2019s poem ends by foreshadowing the fall of Troy in the death of its greatest fighter, Hector. Barker\u2019s novel begins with the fall of another town: Lyrnessus, Briseis\u2019 home, destroyed by Achilles and his men. We then see that the fall of a city is the end of a story only for the male warriors: some leave triumphant and others lie there dead. For the women, it is the start of\u00a0new horrors.Barker is Homeric in her attentiveness to the feel of skin, blood, bones, crackling wounds and screamsBarker keeps the main bones of the Homeric poem in place, supplementing Homer at the end of the story with Euripides. His heartbreaking play The Trojan Women is, like Barker\u2019s novel, a version of the story that shifts our attention from the angry, des-tructive, quick-footed, short-lived boys to the raped, enslaved, widowed women, who watch their city burn and, if they are lucky, get a moment to bury their slaughtered children and grandchildren before they are taken far away. One of Barker\u2019s most tear-jerking sequences is lifted straight from Euripides: the teenage daughter of Priam and Hecuba is gagged and killed as a \u201csacrifice\u201d on the dead Achilles\u2019 tomb, and then Hecuba is presented with the tiny corpse of her dead grandson, a toddler with his skull cracked open. The girl\u2019s gagged mouth and the child\u2019s gaping brains conjure a gruesome twinned image for the silenced voices that should tell of the horror and pity suffered by the victims of war.For most of Barker\u2019s novel, Briseis is the first-person narrator, but in the final part, the narrative is intercut with third-person chapters told from the point of view\u00a0of Achilles. We never get as close to Achilles as we do to Briseis, but he is a compelling figure in his fascinating combination of brutality and civility. Like Siegfried Sassoon in Barker\u2019s 1991 novel Regeneration, this Achilles has the soul of a poet as well as of a killer and hunter: he is a man whose physical courage and compulsion to fight sit uneasily with his clear, articulate awareness of the futility of war.But Achilles, however fascinating he may be, is not at the centre of this story. The novel provides a moving, thought-provoking version of what is perhaps the most famous moment of The Iliad: when the old king Priam makes his way, alone and unarmed, through the enemy camp, to plead with Achilles to give back the mutilated body of his son, Hector. Barker twice quotes Priam\u2019s Homeric words to Achilles: \u201cI do what no man before me has ever done, I kiss the hands of the man who killed my son.\u201d Barker lets us feel the\u00a0pathos and pity of this moment, as well as the pathos of all the many young men who die violent deaths far from home. We glimpse, too, Achilles\u2019 alienation from his own \u201cterrible, man-killing hands\u201d, which have caused so many deaths. Briseis has a powerful riposte to Priam\u2019s words, weighing this unique encounter between men against the myriad unremembered horrors suffered by women in war. \u201cI\u00a0do what countless women before me have been forced to do. I spread my legs for the man who killed my husband and my brothers.\u201dBarker\u2019s novel has a very clear feminist message about the struggle for women to extricate themselves from male-dominated narratives. In the hands of a lesser writer, it could have felt preachy. The attempt to provide Briseis with a happy ending is thin, and sometimes the female characters\u2019 legitimate outrage seems a bit predictable, as when we hear Helen thinking: \u201cI\u2019m here. Me. A person, not just an object to be looked at and fought over.\u201dCan Homer's Iliad speak across the centuries?Read moreThe novel has some anachronisms, such as a \u201cweekend market\u201d (there were no weekends in antiquity), and a reference to \u201chalf a crown\u201d, as if we were in the same period as Barker\u2019s first world war novels. One wonders if any woman in archaic Greece, even a former queen, would have quite the self-assurance of Barker\u2019s Briseis. But, of course, there is\u00a0no way to be sure: no words from women in this period survive but Barker is surely right to paint them as thoughtful, diverse, rounded human beings, whose humanity hardly ever dawns on their captors, owners and husbands. This central historical insight feels entirely truthful.Barker has a quasi-Homeric gift for similes: \u201cthat shining moment, when the din of battle fades and your body\u2019s a rod connecting earth and sky\u201d, or Achilles\u2019 friend Patroclus dying, \u201cthrashing like a fish\u00a0in a pool that\u2019s drying out\u201d. There is a Homeric simplicity and drive in some of the sentences: \u201cBlood, shit and brains \u2013 and there he is, the son of\u00a0Peleus, half beast, half god,\u00a0driving on to glory.\u201d She is Homeric, too, in her\u00a0attentiveness to what happens between people, and to the details of the physical world: the food, the\u00a0wine, the clothes, the noise and the feel of skin, blood, bones, crackling wounds and screams. Barker, like Homer, understands grief and loss, and sees how\u00a0alone people can be even\u00a0when they are crying together. Loneliness in community is one of\u00a0the major themes of this book, as it is of The Iliad. The gods remain mostly off stage but they are present in the background, magically restoring the mutilated dead body of Hector. The sea\u00a0goddess Thetis, Achilles\u2019 mother, is a briny, frightening presence, as are the dark shore and\u00a0the waves by which the whole horrible story takes place.This is an important, powerful, memorable book that invites us to look differently not only at The Iliad but at our own ways of telling stories about the past and the present, and at how anger and hatred play out in our societies. \u201cThe defeated go down in history and disappear, and their stories die with them.\u201d Barker\u2019s novel is an invitation to tell those forgotten stories, and to listen for voices silenced by history and power. Emily Wilson translated The Odyssey (Norton) and The\u00a0Trojan Women and other plays by Euripides for The Greek Plays (Modern Library).

Photograph: Tony Reed/Splash News/CorbisNicola Davis@NicolaKSDavisSun 11 Oct 2015 23.00 AEDTLast modified on Fri 30 Oct 2020 03.28 AEDTWhen I was a kid, my mother would sneak brussels sprouts on to my plate. I hated those revolting little orbs of bitterness \u2013 but Mother was wily. \u201cIt\u2019s only a small one,\u201d she\u2019d say, as though diminutive size suddenly rendered the unpalatable acceptable.I suspect Carlo Rovelli would get on well with my mother. He too is attempting to woo a tough crowd with a portion of something they find hard to swallow: physics. And he\u2019s opting for a similar approach, issuing what JD Salinger would no doubt term a \u201cpretty skimpy-looking book\u201d, just 78 pages long, no doubt hoping his delicate touch will stir up a taste for the subject.Born of a series of articles in an Italian newspaper and covering just seven topics, Rovelli\u2019s book conveys a simple truth: physics is beautiful and awe-inspiring, its mysteries there for us all to muse upon. And his tone would give Brian Cox a run for his quarks. Elementary particles, he writes, \u201ccombine together to infinity like the letters of a cosmic alphabet to tell the immense history of galaxies, of the innumerable stars, of sunlight, of mountains, woods and fields of grain, of the smiling faces of the young at parties and of the night sky studded with stars\u201d.Despite its austere title, Seven Brief Lessons on Physics is no primer for the budding student, rather a curious paean to science. Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, quantum mechanics and the cosmos are covered, but other bastions of the lecture hall, from optics to condensed matter, get the boot in favour of loop quantum gravity and consciousness. For each, Rovelli unpicks the basics before revealing the loose ends scientists have yet to tidy up.And there is plenty of food for thought. \u201cThe difference between past and future only exists when there is heat,\u201d explains Rovelli, deftly leading to the sort of existential ponderings more commonly fuelled by late nights and a bottle of red. \u201cWhat is the \u2018present\u2019?\u201d he asks, pointing out \u201cin physics there is nothing that corresponds to the notion of the \u2018now\u2019\u201d. The flow of time, he implies, is simply a matter of statistics.Seven brief lessons on physics - podcastRead moreRovelli has a rare knack for conveying the top line of scientific theories in clear and compelling terms without succumbing to the lure of elaborate footnotes. \u201cPlanets circle around the sun, and things fall, because space curves,\u201d he writes, neatly summarising the ramifications of Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.His attempts at closing the distance between himself (a leading theoretical physicist) and his readers (who, he admits, are likely to \u201cknow little or nothing about modern science\u201d) are perhaps less successful, describing his student digs as a \u201crefuge from the tedium of university classes in Bologna\u201d in the manner of a politician angling to be judged \u201cof the people\u201d by hanging out at a local pub. And Rovelli occasionally comes a cropper in his explanations, complacently slipping in references and terminology unlikely to ring bells with his readers. Einstein\u2019s \u201cbox of light\u201d thought experiment is bandied about to underline the great man\u2019s scepticism of the later developments of quantum theory, but with no explanation of its thrust, the passage merely frustrates.On the whole his spartan offering is a breath of fresh air. However, it remains to be seen if his pared-back approach could be married with a more in-depth take on physics. Capturing the imagination of a reader is one challenge, but delving deeper while retaining an accessible air is quite another: Richard Feynman, Rovelli is not. Still, perhaps his shorter form is for the best \u2013 in exploring the link between physics and the \u201cself\u201d, Rovelli\u2019s occasionally florid tone is given full flight. \u201cAmidst the infinite arabesques of forms which constitute reality we are merely a flourish among innumerably many such flourishes,\u201d he writes, throwing measured enthusiasm out the window.Rovelli\u2019s approach might be refreshing, but it is still an acquired taste.Seven Brief Lessons on Physics is published by Allen Lane (\u00a39.99).

The novel opens as Nick \u2013 \"I used to be a writer\u2026 back when people read things on paper, back when anyone cared about what I thought\" \u2013 finds that Amy has gone missing on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary. Their front door is open, the coffee table shattered, books scattered, and Amy, a trust fund New Yorker who has been miserable since Nick dragged her to his Missouri home town to care for his dying mother, is gone.Nick calls the police, of course, but there's something off about his reactions. He keeps referring to Amy in the past tense, and then catching himself. He ponders her \"finely shaped head. You could imagine the skull quite easily\". And he is not quite worried enough about her disappearance. \"I felt myself enacting Concerned Husband,\" he says. \"I wasn't sure what to say now. I raked my memory for the lines. What does the husband say at this point in the movie? Depends on whether he's guilty or innocent.\"Gone Girl switches between Nick's narrative, as the hunt for the beautiful, blond Amy consumes the attention of America's media, and Amy's diary, as she writes about the early days of their relationship. \"Tra and la! I am smiling a big adopted-orphan smile as I write this\u2026 I met a boy!\" she says. And then later: \"He promised to take care of me, and yet I feel afraid.\"Gradually the two stories begin to converge. The pointed finger of media \u2013 and police \u2013 blame starts to swing Nick's way, and he doesn't endear himself to his readers as a hint of misogyny enters his tone. Women have \"girl brain[s]\" and female scents, \"vaginal and strangely lewd\". He lies to the police: little lies that don't really\u00a0matter, but why is he doing it? And there's something odd about Amy's diary too; her version of the events of their past is different from Nick's, fails to ring quite true, grates in its perfection. We begin to see flashes of the darkness which lies in the cracks of this seemingly perfect marriage: where is Amy, and who is telling the truth?Flynn, an extraordinarily good writer, plays her readers with the finesse and delicacy of an expert angler. She wields her unreliable narrators \u2013 and just who are they? \u2013 to stunning effect, baffling, disturbing and delighting in turn, practically guaranteeing an immediate reread once her terrifying, wonderful conclusion is reached. This American author shook up the thriller scene in 2007 with her debut Sharp Objects, nasty and utterly memorable. Gone Girl, her third novel, is even better \u2013 an early contender for thriller of the year and an absolute must read.TopicsThrillersThe ObserverFictionGillian FlynnreviewsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

King is a not a writer, in the usual sense; he's an industry. According to Forbes, he makes in excess of $50,000,000 a year (and I didn't accidentally add a few zeros). It all began in 1974 with his first novel Carrie, about a teenage girl with supernatural powers. Some 30 novels and half a dozen story collections later, the man has never looked back, pounding out blockbusters in a way that redefines the word. Not since Dickens has a writer had so many readers - I confess to being one of them - by the throat. Much of his fiction has, of course, been turned into films. As if this weren't enough, King has also written five novels under the name of Richard Bachman and spun out nearly a dozen screenplays or teleplays. On top of which, he's a nice guy. The niceness comes through in his books, encoded in the voice itself: a loud but down-to-earth, friendly and innocent voice that might be America (or America's vision of itself) talking. The fact is, King has got more of postwar America into his fiction than almost any other writer now at work. That he has chosen to write in a particular genre - horror - has, unquestionably, worked against his critical reputation. Perhaps rightly, critics have wondered about his seriousness. The novels are terribly uneven, and even the best of them - The Shining, Pet Sematary, Dolores Claiborne, The Green Mile, Bag of Bones - tend to puff and wheeze after a while like an overweight man on a treadmill. Only his most recent novel, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, is tautly written. Nevertheless, King's imagination is vast. He knows how to engage the deepest sympathies of his readers, and they have rewarded him handsomely. Lately, King has been on the literary equivalent of a rampage. Bag of Bones was a big, distorted yet wonderfully entertaining novel that rode high on the bestseller lists in 1998. Hard on the heels of that success came a fine collection of stories, Hearts in Atlantis (1999). That same year, he also published The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon - a chilling, often beautiful novel about a young girl lost in the woods. For almost the first time, reviewers sat up respectfully, noting the depth and shapeliness of this work. One could no longer dismiss King as just another bad writer proffering cheap thrills to the multitudes. That same year, he brought out his first electronic book, Riding the Bullet. This novella was the world's first mass-market e-book, released through his conventional publisher, Scribner. Half a million downloads later, the publishing industry had to face up to something new under the sun. Soon the idea occurred to King that he might try e-publishing without a conventional publisher in the background. He would simply post a book on his website and request a dollar from anybody who downloaded it. Instead of writing something fresh, however, he rooted through his bottom drawer and found a long-abandoned piece of fiction called The Plant. It's a revenge fantasy about a frustrated author who sends a man-eating vine to devour his publishers. \"My friends,\" King wrote on his website (www.stephenking.com), \"we have the chance to become Big Publishing's worst nightmare.\" Although not as successful as Riding the Bullet, the new work did well enough to please King. (For the record, I sent him a dollar.) Now comes On Writing: A Memoir. It is part biography, part collection of tips for the aspiring writer. In the final chapters, King tells, in graphic detail, the story of his recent accident. In June 1999 he was near his home in Maine, taking his usual four-mile stroll along a rural route. Unexpectedly, a blue Dodge minivan lurched over the hilltop, totally out of control. It was driven by a local man called Bryan Smith. King notes, casually: \"Smith wasn't looking at the road on the afternoon our lives came together because his rottweiler had jumped from the very rear of his van into the backseat area, where there was an Igloo cooler with some meat stored inside.\" Smith thought at first that he had hit \"a small deer\". It was King he hit. After bouncing off the windscreen, the author found himself at the side of the road with his lap turned the wrong way. One of his legs was broken in nine places, \"like so many marbles in a sock\", as his surgeon later explained. He had a collapsed lung and lacerations on his scalp. His devoted wife Tabitha (herself a novelist) stayed by him through several agonising weeks during which it was not clear whether King would ever walk again. His three grown children - Joe, Naomi and Owen - were by his side as well. King's gratitude shines through this memoir. One comes away from it liking King a great deal and admiring his family. Understanding her husband's compulsion to write, Tabitha established the wheelchaired King at a makeshift desk in a hallway of their rambling Victorian house only five weeks after the accident. That King could possibly summon the will to work in this situation is nothing less than astounding. He wrote a little at first, then a lot. Soon, it was business as usual: the author as locomotive, charging down the tracks of narrative, rock music blaring in the background. The pages gathered on his desk. In the 15 or so months since his accident, he has poured out the e-novella, Riding the Bullet, most of a teleplay in six hour-long parts for American television, and a 900-page novel, Dreamcatcher. Oh, yes, and he added the memoir of his accident to a book about the craft of writing that he'd already finished. King has nothing much to say about writing that isn't obvious. \"In my view, stories and novels consist of three parts,\" he explains with professorial solemnity: \"narration, description, and dialogue.\" He warns us: \"The adverb is not your friend.\" He advises writing behind a closed door: \"It is your way of telling the world and yourself that you mean business; you have made a serious commitment to write and intend to walk the walk as well as talk the talk.\" Oh dear. King is infinitely better at writing than talking about writing, though fans will doubtless find moments of interest here, especially when he talks about his own extraordinary writing habits. The best part of the book remains his account of how writing - and the primitive urge to write - saved his life after the accident. It's a bizarre and absorbing story, told brilliantly by one of the great storytellers of our time. One only hopes he lives to write many more books, however uneven. I would not begrudge him a single item on his bibliography. He is, after all, the King.\n\u0095 Jay Parini's novels include The Last Station and Benjamin's Crossing.TopicsBiography booksStephen KingreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

When we look at them, fascination and repulsion uneasily mixed, we bow our heads to their contribution to knowledge, but it is hard to locate their humanity. The thread of empathy has frayed and snapped. They have become objects, more stone than flesh: petrified, post-human.Henrietta Lacks is a medical specimen of quite another kind. No dead woman has done more for the living, and yet we can imagine her easily from her photograph, a vivacious woman who was only 31 years when she died in 1951 in a \"coloured ward\" in Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Beloved by her family, a lively, open-hearted woman, Henrietta died in intractable pain, and at the autopsy her body's interior was pearled by tumours. Towards the end she had been given only palliative treatment, but no one had explained this to her family, who still hoped she might be cured. She left behind a husband and five children, the youngest only a baby. But she also left behind a slice of tissue, a piece excised from the cervical cancer that was her primary tumour. From this sample her cells were cultured.Previously, researchers had found it frustratingly difficult to keep alive fragile human cell lines, but these cells were robust and multiplied at an astonishing rate. In the years following Henrietta's death, the cell line, by laboratory convention known as HeLa, became an unparalleled research tool. Cells were sent to laboratories through the world, bought and sold by research teams. They could be frozen, and their development paused and restarted. Because of them, thousands of experiments on live animals were not needed. Trillions of them are still alive, more than ever grew in Henrietta's living body. They have been employed in research into the polio vaccine, and into the effects of atomic warfare; they were shot into space, used in AIDS research. But the woman who generated them, frequently misnamed, remained largely unknown, and her family benefited not at all from the unwitting donation of her money-spinning tissues.Who was Henrietta Lacks? She was born in Virginia in 1920. Her mother died in giving birth to the last of ten children, and the family were split up, Henrietta going to her grandfather. The family lived in a log cabin, former slave quarters, and tended the tobacco fields as their slave ancestors had done. Henrietta married her cousin and had her first child at 14. She and her husband moved to Baltimore in the hope of greater prosperity, but although she seems to have been a woman of pride and spirit, life dealt her a bad hand. She already had syphilis when her cancer was diagnosed. Her deaf daughter, Elsie, was institutionalised, and the recovery of the circumstances of the child's short life form a grim part of this narrative. Henrietta's other children were brought up in cold, abusive circumstances, knowing little of their mother as a person, and nothing of her part in medical history. When they were told, more than 20 years after her death, that her cells were still alive, they developed not just a sense that they were owed money but also a series of torturing misapprehensions. A cousin explained to the author: \"Nobody round here ever understood how she dead and that thing still living. That's where the mystery's at.\" Joe, Henrietta's youngest son, was born when she was already ill; he served a long prison sentence for homicide and his lifelong delinquencies were attributed by the family to the poisoned environment of his mother's womb. Deborah, Henrietta's daughter, believed that her mother had been cloned, and that she was suffering the pains of all the diseases that her cells had helped to cure.It is not surprising they harboured such fears. Black oral history for years featured \"night doctors\" who abducted children for gruesome experiments, and the folk-beliefs were not entirely irrational. In public hospitals, experiments on black patients \u2013 experiments sometimes dangerous and unethical \u2013 were considered quid pro quo for free treatment. In the shameful Tuskegee project, carried out over forty years, black men were allowed to die from syphilis so that the progress of the disease could be studied. The dark, inhuman face of unpoliced science shows itself throughout this story, side by side with the bright face of discovery and humanitarian advance. The ironies are no less bitter because they are plain: today, Henrietta's descendents cannot afford health insurance. Henrietta was buried in an unmarked grave, in a cemetery with her black ancestors, and with white ancestors who, when the author inquired, would not acknowledge her.Rebecca Skloot revivifies Henrietta, studying her not only as the originator of her cell line but as a woman embedded in history. Her absorbing book is not just about medicine and science but about colour, race, class, superstition and enlightenment, about the painful, transfixing romance of being American. Her tenacious detective work into family history, her crisp and lively summation of the science, are virtues that compensate \u2013 just about \u2013 for a folksy, intrusive, condescending tone. Skloot is a teacher of \"creative non-fiction\", and here the \"creative\" part consists in zigzagging the chronology and appending picturesque details to humanise the hard data. But is the effort needed? If, when Henrietta's cells were first brought into the lab, the technician was eating a tuna salad sandwich, do we really need our brains burdened by that information? It would have been better to trust the story and tell it in as straightforward a way as possible. Skloot's final discussion of the ethics of the use of human tissue is followed by nine pages of acknowledgments that are more than usually fatuous and self-regarding, and the author's determination to write herself into the story distracts the reader from the dense factual background. But The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks succeeds despite itself: it is a fascinating, harrowing and necessary book, marred only slightly by the fact that the author wishes to be considered a heroine for writing it.

In Some Hope, the father, David, is a doctor who almost never sees patients, an aesthete and penniless member of the gentry who has married a rich American. \"By marrying Eleanor he had obliterated the poverty which constituted his great social weakness.\" In their house in Provence (in the village of Lacoste, where the Marquis de Sade's ruined chateau sprawls), David lives surrounded by \"the spoils of Eleanor's matriarchal American family\", drawings by Guardi and Tiepolo, Piazetta and Novelli. David is as cruel if not as inventive and inexhaustible as his great predecessor at Lacoste; his wife is more consciously self-destructive than any Justine.David, who has Dorian Gray's gift of remaining facially unmarked by his vices, beats and buggers his little son, Patrick. He makes his wife crawl on the floor and eat out of a dog bowl, or orders her to eat ripe fallen figs from the ground in front of guests. He tortures the maid by engaging her in protracted conversation when her aching arms are full of a heavy burden. When he's not mistreating his nearest and dearest, David smokes opium or exchanges bitchy remarks with his appalling guests from England.Little Patrick, not surprisingly, grows up to be a heroin addict and a pretty miserable specimen. The great event of his early adulthood is his father's death, which he greets with mixed feelings. When Patrick is \"grieving\" and high on heroin at a gentlemen's club, he is forced to contemplate a menu: \"He sat astonished in front of the menu, as if he had never seen one before. There were pages of dead things - cows, shrimps, pigs, oysters, lambs - stretched out like a casualty list, accompanied by a brief description of how they had been treated since they died - skewered, grilled, smoked, and boiled. Christ, if they thought he was going to eat these things they must be mad.\"Much of the trilogy benefits from this Mars-eye view of the world, what the Russian formalists called \"defamiliarisation\". Paradoxically, if existence itself is observed from a great distance, Patrick's privileged milieu is very much seen with an insider's view of social foibles and rituals. The last section of Some Hope is as funny as anything in Waugh, and as astute about the micro-politics of status as the great Margaret Thatcher scene in Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty. I laughed out loud reading many of the exchanges, some of them with Princess Margaret. A character speaks of his AA meetings: \"'I've found more genuine love and kindness in those meetings than I've seen in all the fashionable drawing rooms of London.' 'Well, that's not saying much,' said Ali. 'You could say the same thing about Billingsgate fish market.'\" Of course a novel is not made out of witty dialogue. The subtext of Some Hope in its entirety is Patrick's relationship with his father, and even in the midst of a country weekend the young man is rethinking his love and his hate for the dead patriarch.Mother's Milk takes up this theme in a new key. Now Patrick is married and, like his father, in a profession he doesn't really practise. He is troubled by the possibility that he may be passing along to his children the taint of his poisoned rapport with his father. Patrick's wife, Mary, is also so consumed by her fears of repeating with her sons the mistakes her cold-blooded mother made with her that she abandons her husband altogether in favour of the role of a 24-hour-a-day nanny. \"Patrick was always saying that their erotic, conversational and social lives were over, that they were just parental bureaucrats.\"The burdens of self-consciousness (in Patrick but also in his older son, Robert) can be excruciating. Patrick is so concerned with shaping Robert's mind that he forgets to let the child play. Mary is so committed to her children that she forgoes her natural love of solitude: \"Neglected meanings piled up like unopened letters. She knew they contained ever more threatening reminders that her life was unexamined.\" Robert reflects back to Patrick the older man's own inflamed self-consciousness: \"Even if he was an affectionate father, even if he wasn't making the gross mistakes his parents had made, the vigilance he invested in the task created another level of tension, a tension which Robert had picked up.\"Much of the action of the book involves Patrick's mother's estate back in Provence. Though it is in a state of decay, the suburbs are encroaching on the grounds and a highway has been built nearby, it remains a prize, especially since the disposal of an inheritance is always a final expression of parental love in the eyes of the anguished heirs. Eleanor is still alive but confused and angry and beset by Alzheimer's. She is in the hands of an Irish guru-charlatan named Seamus who speaks in bromides and mystical nonsense while advancing his own interests with the deadly concentration of a champion chess player. Patrick launches caustic remarks at Seamus, who pretends not to understand them - until he consolidates his possession over the house and evicts Patrick.A spoiled-brat whininess sometimes irritates the reader, at least this democratic American. Chalk it up to national character, but at times I thought that if Patrick invested half the energy he devoted to regaining his lost family fortune to earning a new one he'd be a far richer and happier man; or if he redirected some of the exquisite sympathy he shows himself on to the boors and philistines surrounding him he'd be better company and a bit more sane.But any objection one could feel toward Patrick he has already anticipated in his exacerbated self-awareness and self-contempt. And if Patrick were more charitable we'd be deprived of the wonderful caustic wit of his observations. I found that even this relentlessly cheerful American was willing to suppress his urge to fix everything and rectify wrongs in order to indulge in the impure and eloquent pleasures of failure and malice. At its worst Mother's Milk might make one wish Freud had never existed to dream up his infernal idea of the lock-step generational perpetuation of neuroses. At its best - and most of the time this closely worked, sparkling novel is at its best - we are grateful that so much wit and attentiveness has been lavished on these slightly spoiled darlings and their navel-gazing offspring. Perhaps the very sprightliness of the prose - its lapidary concision and moral certitude - represents the cure for which the characters yearn. So much good writing is in itself a form of health.&middot Edmund White's most recent book is My Lives (Bloomsbury).TopicsBooksFictionEdward St AubynreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Fairfax Media/Fairfax Media via Getty ImagesKate ClanchyFri 8 Jan 2016 21.30 AEDTLast modified on Wed 29 Nov 2017 22.05 AEDTOn Father\u2019s Day 2005, an Australian window cleaner named Robert Farquharson was driving his young sons back to his estranged wife after an access visit. Halfway home, on a lonely stretch of Geelong road, he swerved across a dam into a deep, manmade pond. He swam free; all three of his children drowned. Farquharson told the police he\u2019d suffered a coughing fit and passed out at the wheel. His wife supported him. The trials and appeal that followed took seven years and gripped Australia. They also drew the attention of one of Australia\u2019s greatest living writers, Helen Garner, who after visiting the \u201clittle white crosses, three of them, knee-deep in grass\u201d embarked on her third book-length account of a court case.This House of Grief is in many ways similar to The First Stone, Garner\u2019s controversial take on a university sexual harassment case, and Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation, the more straightforward \u2013 though still furious \u2013 story of the murder of a working-class Italian-Australian by his student girlfriend. As in these books, Garner takes us into the Victoria Courthouse and lights its daily rituals with her limpid prose: \u201cin the high, white space of Court Eleven, everything gently shone. Counsel\u2019s chairs and microphones waited in rows down the long table. Cool air streamed in from some mysterious source.\u201d Again, she shows us Melbourne\u2019s lawyers, florid in their roles: emotional defence barrister Morrissey, \u201cbig, fair, and bluff, Irish-style, with the bulk and presence of a footballer\u201d; \u201clean, contained-looking\u201d prosecutor Rapke.Again, Garner shows us her facility for recording speech and, even more remarkably, the \u201cwaves of emotion and\u00a0private mental activity\u201d of group listening, now honed to almost hallucinogenic clarity. She conveys the pained excitement of the courtroom as Farquharson is condemned by the evidence of a friend who tricked him into confidences while wearing \u201ca wire down the front of his pants\u201d; then changes pace to give us the thrilling cut\u00a0and thrust as Morrissey takes the betrayer to pieces. Equally vividly, Garner portrays how \u201cthe air in the court became a jelly of confusion and boredom\u201d as all who were listening were bogged down for days in the details of the way Farquharson\u2019s car \u2013 the car about which he was engaged in a bitter and crucial ownership dispute with his wife \u2013 skidded off the road into the water: \u201cThe judge took off his spectacles and violently rubbed his eyes. Journalists sucked lollies to stay awake. Jurors\u2019 mouths went square with the effort to control their gaping yawns.\u201dHere, too, are Garner\u2019s characteristic sympathies: with working people, immigrants, mothers. She is drawn to the drowned boys\u2019 grandparents, Bev and Bob Gambino, as she was to Joe Cinque\u2019s parents. She depicts their daughter, Cindy, as a sensual, heavy lidded, modern Madonna. She detects in the rough young men on the stand \u2013 Cindy Gambino\u2019s new partner, the carpenter who pulled Farquharson out\u00a0of the dam \u2013 \u201cthat little buzz of glamour peculiar to the Australian tradie\u201d. On the other hand, she turns on Rapke\u2019s young, female deputy the acidic eye with which she etched Cinque\u2019s murderer \u2013 the eye for strutting and stilettos and entitlement.And here, in every scene, is Garner herself, thirsty for coffee, wisecracking, observant: her very own USP.\u00a0For she takes the opposite path to\u00a0Truman Capote when it comes to accounts of crime. Rather than abstract herself from the scene, as Capote did writing In Cold Blood, she includes or even obtrudes herself, brandishing her\u00a0armfuls of personal baggage. In The\u00a0First Stone, this method seemed to\u00a0have arrived by accident: Garner wrote impetuously and publicly to the\u00a0accused before the trial or the book began; after that, she was cast as her own gadfly. In Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation, though, when the story is more violent and her involvement more distant, the discussion of personal sympathy became a delicate political tool. It was\u00a0as if by admitting the chips that bristled on her own shoulder \u2013 working class, white, Lutheran, feminist, child of the sexual revolution \u2013 Garner was inviting us to discount them from her story, to get to our own truth. In this third book the approach has changed again. Now, rather than play the alienated gadfly, or get an exclusive angle, she sits and chats to the other writers, weaving herself into the court, the community of witnesses. When Farquharson is convicted, she is knitting, and marks the moment with \u201cone red stitch. Then I knitted to the end of the row, and cast off.\u201dThis is a communal, painful effort: the lawyers and jury are engaged in the\u00a0difficult understanding that a man\u00a0murdered his children, and so is Garner. Together, they watch the police reconstructions of the sinking car, witness the anguish of Farquharson\u2019s wretched, betraying friend. Everyone is resistant to the obvious conclusion: as a lawyer walking past the court says, \u201cI\u2019ve got two reactions to this. He can\u2019t possibly have done it. But there\u2019s no other explanation.\u201d Garner makes herself her own experimental subject: she identifies and dismantles her defences against taking in this thought \u2013 that she hopes, for example that if Farquharson is found not guilty, the boys will be restored to life \u2013 and observes two juries doing the same. Then she takes down her defences against believing that this man was essentially different from her. Painstakingly, she shows us his sisters, his\u00a0gestures, his handkerchief: he was\u00a0ordinary, his life was ordinary, yet he\u00a0really did plan to kill his children because of an argument over a car.This careful record of the mind and its workings, of the strange dance we take toward truth, makes the narrative compelling and the story fresh through all the trials and retrials. It also insists that Farquharson and his children belong to all of us. As Garner says as she returns in her mind to the boys\u2019 graves, after their father\u2019s last appeal is rejected: \u201cEvery stranger grieves for them. Every stranger\u2019s heart is broken. The children\u2019s fate is our legitimate concern. They are ours to mourn.\u201d It\u2019s an elegiac farewell, and indeed the whole book feels final, elegiac \u2013 perhaps because for all the horror, it is so elegantly and calmly written; perhaps because This House of\u00a0Grief completes so many arcs begun in Garner\u2019s previous works; perhaps because it is impossible to imagine it being done better.

After three years recording conversations with people who live and work on the Dart in Devon, she has produced a remarkable homage to it and them, called simply Dart. The poems of Oswald's 1996 debut The Thing in the Gap-Stone Stile were full of well-trimmed lyric borders, reflecting her love of gardening, but no proof against the invading power of water, disrupting our human arrangements and losing itself in itself: \"the very integer / and shape of water disappears in water\". From its burbling beginnings in Cranmere Pool all the way to the sea, Dart is an attempt to give an outline to that disappearing shape, exploring the balance between the river as wild force of nature and biddable resource. But rivers can be many things simultaneously. Heraclitus thought we couldn't step in the same river twice; Wordsworth saw in the river Duddon not flux but continuity, \"what was, and is, and will abide\". Most of the time, Eliot writes in \"The Dry Salvages\", the river is \"unhonoured\" and \"unpropitiated\", without ever ceasing to be the \"strong brown god\" of myth, \"sullen, untamed and intractable\". Dart opens with a scene of primal beginnings. An old man of the river lumbers into the poem like Edward Thomas's Lob, and Oswald's constantly shifting metrics take one of their sudden forward surges: What I love is one foot in front of another. South-south-west and down the contours. I go slipping between Black Ridge and White Horse Hill into a bowl of the moor where echoes can't get out listen a lark spinning around one note splitting and mending it and I find you in the reeds, a trickle coming out of a bark, a foal of a river Oswald prefaces Dart with a list of people she's spoken to about the river, but despite this and marginal notes telling us who says what, \"all voices should be read as the river's mutterings\". Among the local deities muttering with the river's tongue is the King of the Oakwoods, \"who had to be sacrificed to a goddess\", a pattern the river repeats on later victims like local bogeyman, Jan Coo, and an unfortunate canoeist. Dart is \"old Devonian for oak\", and Oswald underlines its sacred associations by mutating \"Flamen Dialis\", the priest of Zeus, into \"Flumen Dialis\", his river. The substratum of mythic violence is very Hughesian, and like the river of Ted Hughes's 1983 sequence, River, the Dart can \"wash itself of all deaths\", though after a drowning Oswald follows the dead man's last thoughts with a respectfully blank page (\"silence\"). \"The water is my only neighbourhood,\" Sean O'Brien wrote in Downriver, and there is scarcely a line of Dart that does not squelch with riverine ooze. Oswald's delight in the liquid textures of language show how much she has absorbed from the most onomatopoeic of all writers, Joyce. As Tom Paulin has reminded us in a recent essay, water was always central to Joyce's aesthetic. In Ulysses Stephen Dedalus is described as \"distrusting aquacities of thought and language\", while Mr Bloom is an inveterate \"waterlover, drawer of water\" and \"watercarrier\". Hydrophilia wins out in Anna Livia Plurabelle, which Joyce told Arthur Power was \"an attempt to subordinate words to the rhythm of water\", \"the rivering waters of, hitherandthithering waters of\" the Liffey. And not just the Liffey: he worked in Oswald's river too, when Anna Livia runs \"like a lech to be off like a dart\". Oswald finds a match for Mr Bloom's descriptive rhapsodies in her water abstractor, verifying his calibration records and monitoring for \"colour and turbidity\". People are forever sifting the Dart or trying to harness its power: tin-extractors, millers washing their wool and making dyes, dairy workers using the water to cool their milk, not to mention its ecosystem of \"round streamlined creatures born into vanishing\". Like Wisdom Hely's sandwich-board men in Ulysses, Dart gives the alphabet human form when a swimmer spells out what she is doing by visualising her body as an S, W and M. Also Joycean, and Hopkinsesque, is Oswald's delight in the water music of the Dart's \"foundry for sounds\", \"jabber of pidgin-river\", and the springy Devonian of words like \"bivvering\", \"slammicking\" and \"shrammed\". Not all the Dart is equally inviting for swimmers. Eliot doesn't go into detail about the colour of his \"strong brown god\", but Oswald properly includes a sewage worker, describing \"a rush, a sploosh of sewage, twenty thousand cubic metres being pumped in\", overlaying her \"sloosh\" with the \"splash\" of all that shit getting dumped in it. From the polluted present she returns to a time \"when oak trees were men\" and \"water was still water\", retelling the story of Brutus, grandson of Aeneas, setting sail from Troy for the Dart (a tale that also turns up in David Jones's The Anathemata, a book whose mythic method has much in common with Oswald's). The river's classical past survives in the names of boats (\"Oceanides Atlanta Proserpina Minerva\"), combining with the accounts of fishermen, boatbuilders and oyster gatherers to freight every passing tide with memory, \"a whole millennium going by in the form of a wave\". Joyce's Anna Livia is careworn and weary by the time she reaches the sea, and the Dart exacts its human toll too, with its old river pilots groaning about their arthritis but unrepentant (\"tell me another job where you can see the whole sunrise every morning\"). In the poem's last lines 20 seals accompany the Dart out into the sea, and Oswald faithfully records its final Protean transformation: With their grandmother mouths, with their dog-soft eyes, asking who's this moving in the dark? Me. This is me, anonymous, water's soliloquy, all names, all voices, Slip-Shape, this is Proteus, whoever that is, the shepherd of the seals, driving my many selves from cave to cave . . . This is a heartening book for all sorts of reasons. Oswald shows that poetry need not choose between Hughesian deep myth and Larkinesque social realism. Dart frequently combines the two, moving in the same sentence from religious invocation to marketing jabber (\"may He pull you out at Littlehempston, at the pumphouse, which is my patch, the world's largest operational Sirofloc plant\"). She shows, post-New Generation, that wry ironies and streetwise demotic do not exhaust the avaliable range of tonal and thematic possibilities. She offers, in a word, what too much contemporary poetry forbids itself: ambition. Oswald joins Ciaran Carson, Iain Sinclair, Hughes and ultimately Joyce himself as one of the great celebrants of the genius loci, the spirit of place, or what the Irish call dinnseanchas, lovingly elaborated topographical lore. According to Stephen Dedalus, Epictetus was \"an old gentleman who said that the soul is very like a bucketful of water\". Oswald has soul in riverfuls. \u00b7 David Wheatley is co-editor of Metre magazine.TopicsBooksTS Eliot prize for poetryPoetryAwards and prizesTS Eliot prize for poetry 2002Alice OswaldreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This is a very great novel, but one that needs a context in both the past and in so-called post-9/11 America.We can divide the contemporary American novel into two traditions, or two social classes. The Tough Guy tradition comes up from Fenimore Cooper, with a touch of Poe, through Melville, Faulkner and Hemingway. The Savant tradition comes from Hawthorne, especially through Henry James, Edith Wharton and Scott Fitzgerald. You could argue that the latter is liberal, east coast/New York, while the Tough Guys are gothic, reactionary, nihilistic, openly religious, southern or fundamentally rural.The Savants' blood line (curiously unrepresentative of Americans generally) has gained undoubted ascendancy in the literary firmament of the US. Upper middle class, urban and cosmopolitan, they or their own species review themselves. The current Tough Guys are a murder of great, hopelessly masculine, undomesticated writers, whose critical reputations have been and still are today cruelly divergent, adrift and largely unrewarded compared to the contemporary Savant school. In literature as in American life, success must be total and contrasted \"failure\" fatally dispiriting.But in both content and technical riches, the Tough Guys are the true legislators of tortured American souls. They could include novelists Thomas McGuane, William Gaddis, Barry Hannah, Leon Rooke, Harry Crews, Jim Harrison, Mark Richard, James Welch and Denis Johnson. Cormac McCarthy is granddaddy to them all. New York critics may prefer their perfidy to be ignored, comforting themselves with the superlatives for All the Pretty Horses, but we should remember that the history of Cormac McCarthy and his achievement is not an American dream but near on 30 years of neglect for a writer who, since The Orchard Keeper in 1965, produced only masterworks in elegant succession. Now he has given us his great American nightmare.The Road is a novel of transforming power and formal risk. Abandoning gruff but profound male camaraderie, McCarthy instead sounds the limits of imaginable love and despair between a diligent father and his timid young son, \"each other's world entire\". The initial experience of the novel is sobering and oppressive, its final effect is emotionally shattering.America - and presumably the world - has suffered an apocalypse the nature of which is unclear and, faced with such loss, irrelevant. The centre of the world is sickened. Earthquakes shunt, fire storms smear a \"cauterised terrain\", the ash-filled air requires slipshod veils to cover the mouth. Nature revolts. The ruined world is long plundered, with canned food and good shoes the ultimate aspiration. Almost all have plunged into complete Conradian savagery: murdering convoys of road agents, marauders and \"bloodcults\" plunder these wastes. Most have resorted to cannibalism. One passing brigade is fearfully glimpsed: \"Bearded, their breath smoking through their masks. The phalanx following carried spears or lances ... and lastly a supplementary consort of catamites illclothed against the cold and fitted in dogcollars and yoked each to each.\" Despite this soul desert, the end of God and ethics, the father still defines and endangers himself by trying to instil moral values in his son, by refusing to abandon all belief.All of this is utterly convincing and physically chilling. The father is coughing blood, which forces him and his son, \"in their rags like mendicant friars sent forth to find their keep\", on to the treacherous road southward, towards a sea and - possibly - survivable, milder winters. They push their salvage in a shopping cart, wryly fitted with a motorcycle mirror to keep sentinel over that road behind. The father has a pistol, with two bullets only. He faces the nadir of human and parental existence; his wife, the boy's mother, has already committed suicide. If caught, the multifarious reavers will obviously rape his son, then slaughter and eat them both. He plans to shoot his son - though he questions his ability to do so - if they are caught. Occasionally, between nightmares, the father seeks refuge in dangerously needy and exquisite recollections of our lost world.They move south through nuclear grey winter, \"like the onset of some cold glaucoma dimming away the world\", sleeping badly beneath filthy tarpaulin, setting hidden campfires, exploring ruined houses, scavenging shrivelled apples. We feel and pity their starving dereliction as, despite the profound challenge to the imaginative contemporary novelist, McCarthy completely achieves this physical and metaphysical hell for us. \"The world shrinking down to a raw core of parsible entities. The names of things slowly following those things into oblivion. Colours. The names of birds. Things to eat. Finally the names of things one believed to be true.\"Such a scenario allows McCarthy finally to foreground only the very basics of physical human survival and the intimate evocation of a destroyed landscape drawn with such precision and beauty. He makes us ache with nostalgia for restored normality. The Road also encapsulates the usual cold violence, the biblical tincture of male masochism, of wounds and rites of passage. His central character can adopt a universal belligerence and misanthropy. In this damnation, rightly so, everyone, finally, is the enemy. He tells his son: \"My job is to take care of you. I was appointed by God to do that ... We are the good guys.\" The other uncomfortable, tellingly national moment comes when the father salvages perhaps the last can of Coke in the world. This is truly an American apocalypse.The vulnerable cultural references for this daring scenario obviously come from science fiction. But what propels The Road far beyond its progenitors are the diverted poetic heights of McCarthy's late-English prose; the simple declamation and plainsong of his rendered dialect, as perfect as early Hemingway; and the adamantine surety and utter aptness of every chiselled description. As has been said before, McCarthy is worthy of his biblical themes, and with some deeply nuanced paragraphs retriggering verbs and nouns that are surprising and delightful to the ear, Shakespeare is evoked. The way McCarthy sails close to the prose of late Beckett is also remarkable; the novel proceeds in Beckett-like, varied paragraphs. They are unlikely relatives, these two artists in old age, cornered by bleak experience and the rich limits of an English pulverised down through despair to a pleasingly wry perfection. \"He rose and stood tottering in that cold autistic dark with his arms out-held for balance while the vestibular calculations in his skull cranked out their reckonings. An old chronicle.\"Set piece after set piece, you will read on, absolutely convinced, thrilled, mesmerised with disgust and the fascinating novelty of it all: breathtakingly lucky escapes; a complete train, abandoned and alone on an embankment; a sudden liberating, joyous discovery or a cellar of incarcerated amputees being slowly eaten. And everywhere the mummified dead, \"shrivelled and drawn like latterday bogfolk, their faces of boiled sheeting, the yellowed palings of their teeth\".All the modern novel can do is done here. After the great historical fictions of the American west, Blood Meridian and The Border Trilogy, The Road is no artistic pinnacle for McCarthy but instead a masterly reclamation of those midnight-black, gothic worlds of Outer Dark (1968) and the similarly terrifying but beautiful Child of God (1973). How will this vital novel be positioned in today's America by Savants, Tough Guys or worse? Could its nightmare vistas reinforce those in the US who are determined to manipulate its people into believing that terror came into being only in 2001? This text, in its fragility, exists uneasily within such ill times. It's perverse that the scorched earth which The Road depicts often brings to mind those real apocalypses of southern Iraq beneath black oil smoke, or New Orleans - vistas not unconnected with the contemporary American regime.One night, when the father thinks that he and his son will starve to death, he weeps, not about the obvious but about beauty and goodness, \"things he'd no longer any way to think about\". Camus wrote that the world is ugly and cruel, but it is only by adding to that ugliness and cruelty that we sin most gravely. The Road affirms belief in the tender pricelessness of the here and now.

The title describes Didion's attempt to imagine, will and feel back into existence her husband, novelist and scriptwriter John Gregory Dunne, after his sudden death from a heart attack. Throughout most of the year, their daughter, Quintana Roo, was in hospital with a vaguely diagnosed neurological condition. Didion simultaneously grieves for her husband and worries for her daughter, attempting, as one would expect from such a distinguished writer and journalist, to find some form of words that could provide a structure for channelling her overwhelming, foaming grief. She writes: 'In time of trouble, I had been trained since childhood, read, learn, work it up, go to the literature.'She seizes on snatches of poems, some by the great, incantatory poets, Hopkins and Eliot, but most frequently on a line attributed to King Arthur's nephew, Gawain, when he predicted his own death: 'I tell you that I shall not live two days.' The bluntness with which 'two days' defiantly abuts 'live' alongside the authoritative repetition of 'I', gives the phrase a declamatory finality which admits no contradiction. It echoes throughout the book as Didion tries to discover if Dunne sensed or foresaw his death, an inquisition that only grows deeper with the knowledge that she will never know the answer.Geography changes after death. At any given location, the past is poised to intrude, with memories lined up one behind the other. So close to death, there are no happy memories, for even if their content is sunny, they figure an absence that was only recently filled by a fleshy companion. Life after Dunne is an alien landscape that Didion only gradually begins to comprehend. The present is a foreign country.The brilliance of the book is that it is written with a distracted lucidity, an attitude that fixes the parts with unclouded clarity but repeatedly experiments to see how they fit together. We are never certain whether the forms of words Didion uses are ones that she is remembering having used to describe her grief or ones that she is working through, even in the midst of writing. Though she cannot magic Dunne back, her poetic writing has a spell-like charm that is profoundly affecting.TopicsBooksThe ObserverJoan DidionReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

So much so, that Joanna Blythman can write a tirade on how rubbish we are at cooking, eating and buying our daily meals, consuming \"more junk than the rest of Europe put together\", yet gamble on there being enough of us willing to read her to underwrite an advance - a contradiction as beguiling as our watching hours of Gordon Ramsay while stuffed with the very filth he imprecates. She does a fine demolition job on British pretensions to culinary sophistication, throwing into a bubbling pot of disdain our infinite appetite for potato crisps and snack foods, our inability to eat meals at the dining table (sales of which have plummeted in these Ikea years), the easy and arrogant monopoly of the likes of Tesco, and the stupid pick-and-mix of flavours demonstrated on restaurant menus up and down the land. It's a grand knockabout, most of which is true. The big question is: so what? We live longer than we ever did; we are, generally speaking, in better health; everything else is an optional extra. We might do better, we might enjoy it more, be more graceful in our habits; but we should also doff a cap of recognition to the progress we have made thanks in teensy part to the efforts of the food industry. No one, not even Blythman, should kid themselves that milk and honey used once to flow in the gutters of England.Is eating a moral act? Should we elevate the animal to the intellectual? Blythman dismisses those who eat from \"a mongrel menu that cannibalises world cuisine and spawns meals that do not gel into a coherent whole because they lack any sound unifying principle\". Since when does the stomach recognise unifying principles, or any form of ethic? Food critics are prone to fallacy if they stray from the strict criteria of taste and flavour.British food critics in particular must beware another philosophical elephant trap: the glorification of our European neighbours. All would be well, they say, if only we were like Tia Maria from Andalusia. The sorry fact is that our food habits (give or take our starting point, which in Britain was pretty far to the rear) are as much creatures of economic and social change as they are the consequence of a ready supply of paella. In France, the number of farms is plummeting daily, the proportion of agricultural workers in free fall, the time allocated to cookery in French households declining as precipitately as it has done in Britain, restaurant food is rubbish, and that little neighbourhood bistro a thing of the past (while pizza is the Frenchman's favourite street food). Each year, they get a little more like us, and Italy and Spain tread closely on their heels. Meanwhile, there is hardly a month's difference in our life expectancies.Michael Pollan, from an American perspective, tends also to the glorification of old Europe as he explores the consequences of \"the omnivore's dilemma\". Unlike most of the animal kingdom, humans will eat (almost) anything. How they make their choices from an infinite larder is a learned skill (while koala bears are never taught to stick to eucalyptus). Those inheriting a strong food tradition (those pesky Europeans) will do the learning better and more quickly than deracinated Americans, thus avoiding thrall to the industrial complex that dominates US food production and supply, to the infinite detriment of the consumer. To demonstrate his thesis, he explores three models: the prairie corn grower powered by chemicals and fossil fuels; the small mixed farm, usually organic, raising animals on cleverly managed grasslands; and the hunter-gatherer obtaining his foods from the wild.He follows their products downstream, all the way to the dining table, allowing plenty of diversions into distribution, marketing and supply. There is much to provoke thought, and not just on the iniquities of industrial food. His exposition of organic agriculture is masterly, not least the necessary distinction between \"industrial\" organic growers (not much better, frankly, than your average intensive, tractor-driving East Anglian) and the self-sufficient one-man-bands who now call themselves \"beyond organic\" and produce real food. But again, some of the reasoning seems glib. He does not address the consequences for world life expectancy and population if there had been no agricultural revolution, if we had stayed with the Slow Food model of production from the 1800s until today. Sometimes benefits outweigh what would be disaster.These smart-alec debating points do not disguise the fact that much of what we (and the US) eat is repellent, is produced in dire conditions and contains ingredients that should be spurned. What is the solution? On the home front, it's simple: cook it yourself. Why ever eat manufactured food, almost all of which is disgusting? For the individual: develop your tastebuds. Properly schooled, they will not let you down. They will certainly not delight in Walker's crisps or Heinz tomato ketchup. And government's, or society's, chief responsibility should be to train those tastebuds.If you want to know what happens when we get dysfunctional about food, read Jason Fagone's Insatiable. He, of course, would disagree, citing Japan (foodies' nirvana), where the subculture of competitive eating is thriving (or was, at any rate, until the untimely deaths by choking of two hapless contestants). In the course of a slightly overlong odyssey in the company of David \"Coondog\" O'Karma and other quixotically named professional stomachs, the reader finds out all he needs to know about this niche of trash culture. Fagone tries to extract some bigger truth, but that seems only to be that humans do some funny things to gain money, fame or satisfaction. So funny indeed, that the reader must weep.\u00b7 Tom Jaine runs Prospect Books, a specialist food imprintTopicsBooksHealth, mind and body booksreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The GuardianMary Beard: an absolute refusal to oversimplify things. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The GuardianRachel Cooke@msrachelcookeSun 5 Nov 2017 17.30 AEDTLast modified on Thu 22 Mar 2018 10.49 AEDTThis book is a mere slip of a thing: at 115 pages, small enough to fit into the most diminutive of bags or even (should you be in striding out mood) the pocket of an overcoat. But size, in this instance, is irrelevant. There are two things you need to know about it. The first is that what Mary Beard has to say is powerful: here are more than a few pretty useful stones for the slingshots some of us feel we must carry with us everywhere we go right now. The second is that most of its power, if not all, lies in its author\u2019s absolute refusal to make anything seem too simple. Even as she tries to be concise and easy on the ear \u2013 the book is adapted from two lectures, one given at the British Museum in 2014, and the other earlier this year \u2013 Beard knows that the matters with which she is concerned are extremely complicated. Before she arms you, then, she makes you think. In this sense, if no other, Women & Power deserves to take its place alongside Kate Millett\u2019s Sexual Politics, the text that first suggested literature as a medium for consciousness-raising.Beard\u2019s primary subject is female silence; she hopes to take a \u201clong view on the culturally awkward relationship between the voice of women and the public sphere of speech-making, debate and comment\u201d, the better to get beyond \u201cthe simple diagnosis of misogyny that we tend a bit lazily to fall back on\u201d. Calling out misogyny isn\u2019t, she understands, the same thing as explaining it, and it\u2019s only by doing the latter that we\u2019re likely ever to find an effective means of combating it. The question is: where should we look for answers? Beard acknowledges that misogyny has multiple sources; its roots are deep and wide. But in this book, she looks mostly (she is a classicist, after all) at Greek and Roman antiquity, a realm that even now, she believes, casts a shadow over our traditions of public speaking, whether we are considering the timbre of a person\u2019s voice, or their authority to pronounce on any given subject.Mary Beard: I almost didn't feel such generic, violent misogyny was about meRead morePersonally, I might have found this argument a bit strained a month ago; 3,000 years lie between us and Homer\u2019s Odyssey, which is where she begins, with Telemachus effectively telling his mother Penelope to \u201cshut up\u201d. But reading it in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, it seems utterly, dreadfully convincing. Mute women; brutal men; shame as a mechanism for control; androgyny and avoidance as a strategy for survival. On every page, bells ring too loudly for comfort.Through the example of Telemachus we learn that silencing the female was once an essential part of growing up as a man \u2013 though shouting at a woman was only one way of achieving it. In Ovid\u2019s Metamorphosis, Io is turned by Jupiter into a cow, and Echo\u2019s voice reduced to a mere instrument for repeating the words of others; when the young princess Philomela is raped, her tongue is cut out, to prevent her denouncing her attacker. Women who did speak in the forum were barely female at all; rather, they were \u201cunnatural freaks\u201d. A first-century Roman anthologist mentions one called Maesia, who successfully defended herself in the courts only \u201cbecause she really had a man\u2019s nature\u201d. Beard urges us not to see this \u201cmuteness\u201d simply as a reflection of women\u2019s more general disempowerment in the classical world. Their exclusion from public speech was, she writes, \u201cactive and loaded\u201d. Their voices were subversive, a threat to the state. Thus was the idea of gendered speech established. If the ancients disliked the sound of the female voice, so high-pitched and strident, in the 21st century terms such as \u201cwhine\u201d still tend to be reserved for women.She is nothing if not pragmatic, her utterances grounded in practicalities as well as learningDoes this matter? Beard thinks that it does. Such language underpins an idiom that, almost without our noticing it, acts to remove the authority (and when necessary the humour) from what women have to say. In other words, no one hears us even when we do speak \u2013 just like the woman in the Punch cartoon she also mentions (\u201cThat\u2019s an excellent suggestion, Miss Triggs. Perhaps one of the men here would like to make it\u201d).What I relish about Beard\u2019s approach is that once she has told us all this \u2013 I am not a classicist, so some of it was new to me \u2013 she doesn\u2019t simply sink down into disapproval and hand-wringing (the fatal flaw of so many recent feminist texts). She wants to know: how can we be heard? And her answers are radical. Why should we settle only for exploiting the status quo \u2013 for instance, by training our voices, as Margaret Thatcher did? Progress, if it is ever to happen, will require a fundamental rethink of the nature of spoken authority, \u201cand what constitutes it, and how we have learned to hear it where we do\u201d. Women are not only going to have to be \u201cresituated\u201d on the inside of power; it may be that power itself has to be redefined. What will such a redefinition involve? She talks of the \u201cdecoupling\u201d of power from prestige, a bifurcation that will mean thinking about power as an attribute rather than as a possession; of the power of followers as well as of leaders.All of this is exciting, and full of possibility (though threatening to some, of course). But Beard isn\u2019t about to drink her own Kool-Aid. She is nothing if not pragmatic, her utterances grounded in practicalities as well as learning. Just as she finds time in her book to attempt to understand, as well as to condemn, the misogyny of Twitter \u2013 some of the abuse is, she is convinced, the result of the false promise it made to put people directly in touch with those in power; women are not the only ones who feel \u201cvoiceless\u201d \u2013 so she is keen to remind the reader of the gloom that hangs all about. Don\u2019t get too perky, she instructs, even as she works to build her case.Some things are hard, if not impossible, to cast off. Should we be in any doubt about the terrifying extent to which the exclusion of women from power is culturally embedded, let alone unsure of the continued strength of classical ways of formulating and justifying it, we have only to look at the Trump campaign in 2016, in which he was depicted, after Cellini\u2019s bronze, as Perseus holding up the severed head of Hillary Clinton as Medusa. His supporters could buy this image on T-shirts and tote bags, coffee cups and laptop covers \u2013 and doubtless many of them did, desperate for the monster to be slain in their own minds, even before they had approached the ballot box.

Peter Carey's skills, passions and obsessions are all fully on display in this long-awaited take on colonial Australia's most enduring myth. Ned Kelly, cattle thief, bank robber and folk hero, was hanged at the age of 25 in Melbourne jail in 1880. Carey tells his story in the first person, in a narrative - recalling Ondaatje's Billy the Kid, Hanson's Jesse James and perhaps even Burroughs's Dutch Schultz - that his publishers refer to as a dazzling act of ventriloquism. But this is not the short-lived gimmickry of ventriloquism; it is writing, and though the voice it renders is loud, distinctive and beguiling, the concessions made by Carey to the modern reader create several potential flaws in the construction that, to begin with at least, threaten to undermine the otherwise carefully woven illusion. Happily, Carey is far too accomplished and adventurous a writer to expect anything so simple or so obvious as the suspension of disbelief in the reader. Rather, he makes a valid and sustained plea for accommodation, for readers to bring all they think they know about Ned Kelly - all those half-remembered childhood memories of a man in the heat of an outback summer with a bucket on his head - and then to allow Carey himself to fill in the empty spaces that remain. We are not seriously expected to believe that this is a transcript of Kelly's own work; we are not so easily fooled by the archive sources cited; we are not so swiftly seduced by the atrocious punctuation in a narrative otherwise so finely tuned, plotted and controlled. What Carey demands of us is what he has been demanding for 20 years: that we trust the narrator of the tale as much as the tale being told, and that we don't unduly concern ourselves as readers with the mode of its telling. Ever since the playful, shape-changing stories of The Fat Man in History, Oscar and Lucinda, Jack Maggs and - supremely - Illywhacker, Carey has been talking out of the side of his mouth and behind his hand. He mumbles and whispers and then turns to face his reader with a look of mock surprise saying: \"What? What don't you believe?\" This Ned Kelly is a convincing and intriguing individual; Carey has indulged his appetite for language and imaginative construction in making him so. It does not matter that we are unable to pin Kelly to the facts of his life, only that we are willing and prepared to accept him as Carey reveals him to us, and to trust the kaleidoscopic array of characters and situations and the often startling images employed by Carey to create them. There is wonder here, and awe. Carey's narrators have always been storytellers in the truest sense. We have always been asked to believe what they are telling us while guessing or half-knowing that it is a well-turned pack of lies. Throughout his career, Carey has concerned himself above all with the image and the identity of his fellow Australians - from the earliest settlers struggling to understand the strangeness and precariousness of their lives and surroundings, to the disappointment and emptiness of contemporary urban man, detached from the vast and legend-filled spaces around him. This is nowhere more evident or more poignant than in those places and lives where only one or two generations might separate these extremes. These are the human spaces Carey inhabits, and at times he seems to have far more in common with his Victorian and Edwardian forbears - with Marcus Clark and Henry Handel Richardson, say - than with any of his more obvious contemporaries. There is little doubt that Carey the storyteller, Kelly the narrator and the tale being told are uniquely well matched. There is little doubt, either, where Carey's sympathies lie. He cannot be faulted for the shape and colour of the portrait he is painting when Kelly himself - the original Wild Colonial Boy - is telling the tale. History, Carey insists, is just as cruel to those figures it remembers (whether well, badly or indifferently) as to those it decently forgets. Kelly himself undoubtedly considered his reckless and ignorant bravery wholly justified, and understood as well as any of his later apologists and worshippers that he was the victim of the casually brutal wilderness and times he inhabited. Carey does little to alter this account. What he does achieve is a picture of a fuller, living man, about whom the reader need know nothing before he starts speaking. It is to Carey's great credit that, as the story progresses, the writer of the novel and the narrator of the tale it tells become indivisible. It is equally to his credit that Kelly's trademark ridiculous bucket headgear - my own abiding childhood memory - is not mentioned until 25 pages from the end of his account. Intriguingly, 10 years ago Robert Drewe published Our Sunshine, a fractured, unsentimental, \"poetic\" and compassionate first-person account of Kelly, of which Carey himself said: \"An important writer meets an important myth and reinvents it in the most sensual, visceral language he has yet produced.\" I anticipate that Robert Drewe will say exactly the same of Carey's Ned Kelly.TopicsBooksFictionBooker prize 2001Awards and prizesPeter CareyBooker prizereviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The first, Queenie, is Gilbert's white landlady; they met during wartime when he came over as an RAF recruit. Returning on the SS Empire Windrush, he looks her up and takes a room in her house. Hortense, the Jamaican girl whom Gilbert married immediately before boarding the boat, arrives later to share his crumbling attic room; and Queenie's long-lost husband, Bernard, finds his way back, a year after his demob, shortly after Hortense has taken up residence. The year is 1948.The interaction between the couples is, to a certain extent, predictable, but a notable feature of the book is that the entire narrative and the stories within it clearly emerge from the memories of the period's survivors. If ever there was a novel which offered a historically faithful account of how its characters thought and behaved, this is it. But the sheer excellence of Levy's research goes beyond the granddad tales of 50-year-old migrant experience, or the nuts and bolts of historical fact. Her imagination illuminates old stories in a way that almost persuades you she was there at the time.Her grip on the language of the characters is another surprise. There is an almost universal confusion in Britain about the nature of Caribbean dialects, and black authors reared in London or Birmingham have tended to reproduce the speech of every sort of Caribbean, regardless of region or class, as the same kind of pop music-inflected street slang, complete with missing consonants and apostrophised accents. Levy has no truck with this sort of gimmick. Instead, she creates a style which reproduces the rhythm and content of her characters' speech. Even more impressive, she does the same for her English characters. Queenie sounds like a Londoner brought up in the early part of the last century. Bernard sounds like a man who has served in the Far East.Levy's immersion in the period seems an illustration of the fact that in recent years, 1948, marking the arrival at Tilbury of the Windrush, has taken on a new significance in the lexicon of Britain's social history. A few years ago, the commemoration of this event sparked off a small explosion of interest in the consequences of mid-20th century migration. Artists and writers of migrant origin, especially Afro-Caribbeans, have responded to this historical platform with a new confidence and interest in exploring both their own roots and the circumstances of the time. The result is a growing conversation about the effects of Caribbean migration on British identity.Levy's authorial platform is balanced squarely in the middle of this conversation. The novel records some of the most un-pleasant racist aspects of the period, without displaying any sense of polemical intent, partly because her reliance on historical fact gives Levy a distance which allows her to be both dispassionate and compassionate. The history also offers an opportunity to construct the characters in patient and illuminating detail.As you read on, however, it becomes apparent that her relentless layering of their personalities has a more subtle purpose. Hortense, for instance, is the least sympathetic character. Brought up with the consciousness that her \"golden skin\" makes her a superior creature in a country of darker skins, she is a village snob, insecure, narrow-minded, and more or less ignorant. Arriving in England with the expectation that it will be an upmarket version of her teacher-training college in Jamaica, she begins by despising the apparently feckless Gilbert and the circumstances to which he has brought her. She looks down her nose at working-class Queenie, and firmly rejects the notion that she has anything in common with the other slum-dwelling migrants. But she soon discovers that her precious qualifications have no meaning in the British education system, and that her status is precisely the same as that of any other black migrant. The revelation almost destroys her self-esteem, but it also sets her on a path to self-discovery. She ends by beginning to understand Gilbert's strength, Queenie's kindness and the sympathies she shares with them.If I have a complaint about the novel it is related to Levy's rigorous adherence to historical fact, which occasionally gives you the feeling that she has been so interested or moved by a particular incident that she's manoeuvred her characters into the right place at the right time. For instance, Gilbert and Queenie are involved in a wartime incident where the US army attempts to impose a segregated seating plan in a local cinema. Gilbert resists and sets off a riot in which Queenie's father-in-law is shot dead by American military policemen. The story is a truthful rendering of several recorded incidents, but in the context of the narrative it has an incongruously melodramatic feel. In much the same way, Bernard's involvement in a mutiny in India, which, once again, fits with recorded fact, also feels, within the context of the book, a little over the top.False notes of this kind, however, do not detract from the excellence of Levy's narrative. Apart from everything else, Small Island is a great read, delivering the sort of pleasure which has been the traditional stock-in-trade of a long line of English novelists. It's honest, skilful, thoughtful and important. This is Andrea Levy's big book.Mike Phillips's London Crossings: A Biography of Black Britain is published by Continuum.TopicsBooksFictionAndrea LevyreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

T\u00f3ib\u00edn's writing isn't humourless; there are darkly comic scenes in The Master and some witty lines of dialogue in The Blackwater Lightship, and his journalism is frequently very funny. But in his novels, on the whole, he's so intent on leading his readers where he wants them without letting them catch him doing it that making them laugh too often might strike him as counterproductive. His fiction works hard to create the illusion that the characters reveal themselves almost independently of the narrating voice. It also aims to depict complicated feelings and interactions with a minimum of fuss and portentousness, using simple words and a precisely controlled tone that implies a certain hush. T\u00f3ib\u00edn, it should be added, has serious interests. These include Catholicism and the legacy of Irish nationalism, the inward sufferings of gay people throughout most of history, and difficult emotional currents within families. Spanish and Latin American politics are part of the background to The South and The Story of the Night, and he touches in several books on the devastation done by Aids to gay men in the 1980s. He writes well about women, often putting them centre stage, and about people who feel compelled to hold their feelings at a distance, his Henry James in The Master being a good example. At the same time, he loves form and imposes strict rules on himself concerning point of view and narrative manipulation, rejecting tricks as firmly as Raymond Carver did. His plain style is unostentatious even in its plainness, avoiding musical balance but also taking care not to seem mannered or excessively clipped. In Brooklyn, T\u00f3ib\u00edn continues to conjure strong emotions from the gaps between his lines, but this time humour has more of a place in the range of available tones. He fits it in partly through lightly comic dialogue. \"No one likes flies,\" a haughty Wexford shopkeeper tells the heroine, a young woman named Eilis Lacey, \"especially on a Sunday.\" Yet the jokes aren't free-floating. T\u00f3ib\u00edn gives Eilis - whose point of view is strictly adhered to throughout - a well-tuned ear for such speech, which she uses to entertain her mother and elder sister. The reader quickly sees that there's something brave and sad about her spirited performances over the dinner table in the economically stagnant provincial Ireland of the early 1950s. Her father is dead; her older brothers, much missed by her mother, are working in England; there are few prospects of marriage and few jobs in Enniscorthy. Eilis's sister Rose, whose earnings from an office job support the family, plays golf in the evenings. At the club she meets a priest, back from America on his holidays, who knew their parents years before. The priest offers to arrange a job in Brooklyn for Eilis, who soon finds herself crossing the Atlantic third-class, fully understanding that, by organising this, Rose has sacrificed her own future. T\u00f3ib\u00edn patiently dramatises Eilis's homesickness and her brushes with enforced American good cheer, her relations with her fellow inmates at an all-Irish boarding house, her work at a moderately enlightened department store, her night classes, and her pleased discovery of all-night heating and affordable women's fashions. In time she meets a handsome Italian-American man who speaks seriously and tactfully of marriage. Then a death summons her back to Ireland, where she finds that America has made her glamorous and desirable, and faces a choice between the old life and the new.This simple-sounding story takes on depth and resonance in a number of ways, starting with what it leaves out. There's no awed first glimpse of the Manhattan skyline; even the account of Eilis's first trip to a baseball game focuses on her boyfriend's way of being with his brothers, not the chance to write a set piece. Overemphasis is almost obsessively dodged. \"'She'll be there. Nothing is any trouble now,' he said\": most writers would have put the speech tag between the two sentences, but not T\u00f3ib\u00edn. Within his stern parameters, however, he's able to convey pathos, sharp observation, and finely detailed psychological realism. Brooklyn's symmetries and neatly circular plotting aren't camouflaged as heavily as the rest of its artistry, but there's no mistaking the book for a conventional historical weepie. The word \"love\" is applied more often to Eilis's feelings about her room or her textbooks than to the men in her life, and T\u00f3ib\u00edn doesn't sentimentalise his central character's experience of either country.We're used to getting these kinds of stories from an American perspective in which moving to America is the natural thing to do. T\u00f3ib\u00edn makes his emigrant's story more painful without simply reversing those assumptions or ruling out an ironic distance from postwar Irish insularity. (A prim young woman from Belfast shares her views on Brooklyn's Italian and Jewish populations: \"I didn't come all the way to America, thank you, to hear people talking Italian on the street or see them wearing funny hats.\") Eilis herself is an interesting character, less defenceless and more troubled than she initially seems, and the novel uncovers the \"dark, uncertain\" areas within her with a very light touch. Her rejection of her landlady's proffered friendship, and her encounter with her sexually wistful female boss, are handled as delicately as any scene T\u00f3ib\u00edn has done, although here and there his delicacy doesn't exclude a note of ribald amusement as well as worldly melancholy.TopicsColm T\u00f3ib\u00ednFictionBrooklynreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The starting place is a point some way into the future, where a character called Snowman is contemplating the devastated landscape around him and his own situation as probably the last human left on earth. Woven through Snowman's struggles to survive among genetic mutations and in the face of gradual starvation is the tale of his past as a naive young man called Jimmy. Jimmy watches as the world hurtles towards a catastrophe that is masterminded by his friend, an over-ambitious scientist called Crake. Although the structure sounds complicated, the novel never loses its forward momentum. Throughout the book the wheels of the plot turn relentlessly; sometimes you feel almost breathless. Will Jimmy reveal how the great biological disaster was released? Will Snowman survive starvation, injury, and attack by mutant monster pigs? It is a cracking read, in other words. But Oryx and Crake lacks some of the subtler imaginative power of Atwood's previous novel set in a dystopian future, The Handmaid's Tale, which was full of convincing detail and had an individual heroine. Oryx and Crake is, by comparison, a more derivative vision. Here too Atwood is putting across a relevant and intelligent political message, which can easily be summed up: don't trust the scientists and the big corporations to run the world.Before catastrophe strikes, the main features of Jimmy's world are based on the gradual exaggeration of some of the most dismal current trends in western society - internet pornography, gated communities, genetic modification. Atwood certainly has a lot of fun imagining the havoc that might be wreaked on the gene pool if scientists were constrained by nothing except the profit motive, with her pigoons (a combination of pig and human genes), wolvogs (wolf and dog), snats (snake and rat) and ChickieNobs (mutations of chickens that are all breast and no brain). Genetic tinkering reaches its apogee in the perfect humanoid creatures that Crake creates as better alternatives to humans, with their skins resistant to ultraviolet light and little interest in sex or violence. She has clearly done her homework on what scientists are getting up to in their crazier moments. Indeed, one of the characteristics of Atwood's recent novels is the sense that they are based on thorough research. Her latest books have mined past eras for their setting - the 19th century for Alias Grace, or 1930s Canada for The Blind Assassin. Sometimes the homework shows through too obviously. For instance when the young Jimmy is introduced to the pigoons, even though he is a child at the time, Atwood's style bypasses childish wonder for the rat-tat-tat of straight explanation: \"The goal of the pigoon project was to grow an assortment of foolproof human-tissue organs . . . that would transplant smoothly and avoid rejection, but would also be able to fend off attacks by opportunistic microbes and viruses . . . A rapid-maturity gene was spliced in so the pigoon kidneys and livers and hearts would be ready sooner . . .\" This kind of brusque tone often recurs. Indeed, although Atwood is one of the most impressively ambitious writers of our time, she is not our greatest stylist. If you compare her prose to that of, say, Donna Tartt or Zadie Smith, it will always seem curiously underworked. She wants to get ideas across to you, not to spend her energy polishing the sentences. Sometimes this means that she lapses into a style that is simply a vehicle for imparting information, and although it is useful for a tale set in the future, in which there is inevitably so much to observe and elucidate, it can begin to grate. The narrative voice becomes almost like a tour guide, always there at your elbow, to explain and clarify. Still, from time to time Atwood does delve more deeply into Jimmy's mind. She is rightly celebrated for her explorations of the female point of view, but here she manages to write convincingly from the point of view of a man - and a man, what's more, brought up in an emotionally stunted environment saturated with pornography and commercialism. Jimmy comes rather poignantly alive, especially in the parts of the novel that deal with his unhappy childhood and his relationship with his depressed and rebellious mother. It is good that he does achieve a certain depth, because he is the only fully realised character whom we meet. Jimmy's friend Crake, who harbours dreams of scientific experimentation that finally take the whole world as a laboratory, should be a crux of the novel, but he is never more than a vehicle for the plot. Perhaps he has to be rather inhuman and unsympathetic to fill this role as an updated Frankenstein, but he remains a shadowy figure to the very end. And what strikes the novel's only really duff note, oddly, is its main female character, Oryx. Oryx is Jimmy's wet dream - indeed, he first glimpses her as a child on an internet porn site: \"She was small-boned and exquisite, and naked like the rest of them, with nothing on her but a garland of flowers and a pink hair ribbon . . . The act involved whipped cream and a lot of licking. The effect was both innocent and obscene.\" After she has met Jimmy in the flesh, Oryx gets the chance to tell him some of her own story, how as a child she was sold into slavery in some south-east Asian country, and then reached freedom in north America; but she always evades showing emotion, and is never more than a beautiful blank. \"'Did they rape you?' Jimmy asks at one point. 'Why do you want to talk about ugly things?' she said. Her voice was silvery, like a music box.\" No doubt this shiny blankness is deliberate, making Oryx an ambiguous figure who hovers between reality and fantasy, but the effect is as bland as candy-floss. Even her violent end takes place with a curious lack of effect. Although Atwood stays so much on the surface of her creations in this novel, she is always intelligent and energetic in the way that she puts the jigsaw together - and, at the end, threatens to dismantle it. As the strange humanoid creatures that Crake has put on earth begin to show something approaching human individualism, the suggestion of another future for the world opens up. Whether it is a hopeful future, or just another way into disaster, is something that is left intriguingly shrouded in mystery. \u00b7 Natasha Walter is the author of The New Feminism (Virago).TopicsBooksBooker prize 2003FictionAwards and prizesMargaret AtwoodBooker prizereviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: BBCAnother life \u2026 Charlotte Coleman as Jess in the BBC production of Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit. Photograph: BBCZoe Williams@zoesqwilliamsFri 4 Nov 2011 20.05 AEDTJeanette Winterson's memoir is written sparsely and hurriedly; it is sometimes so terse it's almost in note form. The impression this gives is not of sloppiness, but a desperate urgency to make the reader understand. This is certainly the most moving book of Winterson's I have ever read, and it also feels like the most turbulent and the least controlled. In the end, the emotional force of the second half makes me suspect that the apparent artlessness of the first half is a ruse; that, in a Lilliputian fashion, what appears to be a straight narrative of her early life is actually tying the reader down with a thousand imperceptible guy ropes, so that when she unleashes a terrible sorrow, there is no escaping it and no looking away.\"Why be happy when you could be normal?\" is the real-life question of her adopted mother, as Winterson is evicted, at 16, for taking up with a second girlfriend (the attempts to exorcise her sexuality after the first having been unsuccessful). There are passages and phrases that will be recognisable to anyone who's read Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit: this is not surprising, since that first, bold announcement of Winterson's talent was a roman \u00e0 clef, and never claimed to be otherwise.So anecdotes and jokes crop up in both books: the mother says the lesbian sweet-shop owners deal in \"unnatural passions\", and the young Jeanette thinks it means they put chemicals in their sweets; the gospel tent, the CB radio, all the memorable details of the first fictional outing come up again, but the point is not that this is repetitive. Rather, that the documents are intended as companions, to lay this one over the last like tracing paper, so that even if the author poetically denies the possibility of an absolute truth, there emerges nevertheless the shape of the things that actually happened. I had forgotten how upbeat Oranges was; it may have been peopled by eccentrics, with a heroine held in alienation by the aspic of impotent childhood, but there were upsides. \"I suppose the saddest thing for me,\" Winterson writes now, \"thinking about the cover version that is Oranges, is that I wrote a story I could live with. The other one was too painful. I could not survive it.\"The upbringing as she tells it now is far bleaker; she was beaten, she was often hungry, she was left all night on the doorstep by a mother whose religious excesses might even have been a secondary influence on the household the first being her depression, which was pervasive and relentless. She was not well loved. However, the story's leavened throughout by other observations. The geopolitics I sometimes found bold, and other times found too broad to be conclusive: \"In a system that generates masses, individualism is the only way out. But then what happens to community \u2013 to society?\" But it wriggles with humour, even as Jeanette describes Mrs Winterson, who, in between her violent homilies and dishonest violence, had like any good tyrant various crucial absurdities \u2013 \"she was one of the first women to have a heated corset. Unfortunately, when it overheated it beeped to warn the user. As the corset was by definition underneath her petticoat dress, apron and coat, there was little she could do to cool down except take off her coat and stand in the yard.\" There is Winterson's quirky favourite hymn (\"Cheer up ye saints of God,\" it starts, \"There is nothing to worry about\"), her loving, impressionistic descriptions of classic authors, from TS Eliot to Gertrude Stein, as she first encounters them. And even with all this new, distressing detail, the story of her childhood ends well \u2013 it ends in escape.Then there's an odd page or two entitled \"Intermission\", which finishes: \"The womb to tomb of an interesting life \u2013 but I can't write my own; never could. Not Oranges. Not now. I would rather go on reading myself as a fiction than as a fact \u2026 I am going to miss out 25 years \u2026 Maybe later \u2026\"And suddenly we are on to territory which is alarming, moving, at times genuinely terrifying; skip forward a quarter century, and Winterson has just split up from her girlfriend, the theatre director Deborah Warner. She finds her adoption papers in the effects of her dad, when he's moving to an old people's home. She has a nervous breakdown and attempts suicide. \"My friends never failed me and when I could talk I did talk to them. But often I could not talk. Language left me. I was in the place before I had any language. The abandoned place.\" At times she describes the process with precision. Other times, though, the scars of this first abandonment are given in the most unadorned, uncharacteristic prose, as though she's trying to gnaw her way through her own sophistication to get to the truth of it. In a way, the presence in the narrative of Susie Orbach, with whom Winterson started a relationship just before she started looking for her birth mother, acts as a reassurance to the reader as much as to the author, a fixed point to whom we can return, whose very inclusion means that, whatever happens, a fresh abandonment won't be the outcome. Otherwise I genuinely think it would be unbearable. At one point I was crying so much I had tears in my ears.There is much here that's impressive, but what I find most unusual about it is the way it deepens one's sympathy, for everyone involved, so that the characters who are demons at the start \u2013 her adoptive mother but also, to a degree, her acquiescent adoptive father \u2013 emerge, by the end, as simply, catastrophically damaged. In the process of uncovering that, she painstakingly unpicks the damage they wreaked on her. The peace she makes with her adoptive family is, in this sense, more important and evocative than the more complicated and double-edged peace that comes with tracking down her birth mother.TopicsAutobiography and memoirJeanette WintersonreviewsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The short biography he used to have on his book jackets began with the information that he was born in 1948 and is still not dead. It went on to say that he began work as a journalist one day in 1965 and saw his first corpse three hours later, \"work experience meaning something in those days\". Like all good storytellers he writes against death, creating impossible escapes, thrilling dangers, the come-uppance of the wicked and so on. But unlike many creators of fantasy worlds he makes sure his readers know death is real, while at the same time finding ingenious devices to help us to accommodate that knowledge. His characters die quite frequently. When they do, they take time to realise what has happened. They are met by Pratchett's personified Death - a skeleton with a scythe, an hourglass and a white horse called Binkie - who has organised himself to resemble what human beings think he is, is courteously inhuman, but has increasing bouts of oddly caring behaviour, prompted by his long association with our agitated species. These matter-of-fact deaths are curiously comforting - people shake themselves and stagger or stroll off in the direction of the horizon. The device means that good characters can die without outrage, though I remember being shocked by the first death I encountered - that of an ordinary, brave dwarf in Men at Arms who, by normal fairy-story rights, should have survived to triumph over evil. Pratchett invented the City Watch of his squirming and insanitary metropolis Ankh-Morpork, he once said, so as to make heroes of the supernumerary guardsmen and extras who are present in most stories simply to be killed in droves to show how bad the bad characters are, before the hero deals out justice. Corporal Carrot of the Watch is just such a hero - with a twist. He is the lost heir to the throne of Ankh-Morpork, has the birthmark and sword to prove it, can control crowds by a kind of charisma, and turn marauding desert Dregs into football teams. But he has the sense - or innocence - to remain a simple guardsman, under Captain Samuel Vimes, who was, when we first met him, a drunken and despondent good cop, and has grown, in the Discworld series, to become commander and then Lord Vimes, keeping order with Carrot and the wily Patrician, or politician, who rules the city, Lord Vetinari. At the end of Jingo, one of the best of the novels, Vimes arrested a whole army and its blimpish commanders for disturbing the peace. He is married to Lady Sibyl Ramkin, a large lady who breeds swamp dragons, and is expecting his child. In Night Watch, Vimes finds himself - along with a peculiarly unpleasant criminal called Carcer - caught in a time-warp, back in his own early days as a Watchman, trying to change the course of a bloody revolution. He is also concerned to prevent his own callow self as a lance-constable from getting killed, so that he may get back to the present and his child may be born. He has become a dead hero called John Keel, who helped to organise the barricades, but was also a Watch captain at Cable Street. His opponents include the corrupt Unmentionables, who arrest and torture people. It is a way of adding to a cumulative tale-series that by now - on ordinary human time-scales - has more unknown events at the beginning than at the end. Its world is, as Vimes has always said it was, rough and nasty. Pratchett has said once or twice recently that his imagination is getting darker. The storyteller's dealings with death have become grimmer and not so calmly comic. The series began as a parody of the fantasy world of sorcerers and magic, with the adventures of the cowardly wizard Rincewind who is always being projected through space-time, accompanied by a bad-tempered piece of luggage on hundreds of little legs. Rincewind survived by being a survivor, and by invoking the million-to-one chance that is a dead cert in a magical tale. He has not appeared for some time now, whereas the characters from the tales of the witches of Lancre and the complicated polity of Ankh-Morpork have appeared more grimly. Evil in Discworld has been getting more solid and nastier, while the ordinary defenders of com mon sense and practical morality have been suffering from exhaustion. Granny Weatherwax, the senior witch in Lancre, began like Vimes as a ribald comic \"character\" and grew into complications and intelligence. She faces real moral problems. She plays (and fiddles) a gambling game against Death for the life of a mother or a child, and then has to choose which to save when she wins. She makes the practical choice, and doesn't ask the husband, who would have made the sentimental one. She has recently been faced with a genuinely nasty set of vampires whose comic edge only makes them nastier - like Pratchett's elves they are supremely speciesist and egocentric. She is given to entering a state of suspended animation during which she carefully hangs a label on herself - \"I aten't dead\", or, more recently, when readers had believed she might have been defeated, \"I STILL aten't dead\". Vimes too, inhabiting his own past as a dead hero, is in a state of suspended animation. I have never liked stories where characters visit either the past or the future of their \"real\" lives - except possibly for A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Such stories attenuate both their reality and the hopes and fears they meet in the story they are now in. This feeling is strong in Night Watch . The alternative Vimes is only a hypothesis. But the nastiness he faces - loosely based on the fascist nastiness of the real Cable Street and on police corruption and torture everywhere - is unusually nasty for Pratchett, and Death's appearances are only perfunctory and not consoling. Human beings love stories because they safely show us beginnings, middles and ends. Our ends are Death and, as I said, Pratchett likes to move wild laughter in its throat. His real horrors are the Undead, and the bad witch trapped in a hall of mirrors unable to find the door to life or death, and the ghouls who try to invade from beyond the confines of space-time. There is something a bit sleight-of-hand about turning Vimes into an Undead and making him face real horrors in an alternative past. This weakening of fictive reality is not compensated for by our meetings with the young Vetinari as a junior member of the Assassins' Guild, or the urchin Nobby as a police informer, or the dead-rat salesman Dibbler before he got his slogan of \"Cut-me-own-throat\". But there is one lovely touch. One of the dead Watch heroes is the stolid Reg Shoe - who will reappear as a conscripted zombie, greenish, smelly and prone to lose body-parts, in the multispecies Watch of the fictive present. Stories both trap people in a continuum and console them with images of beginnings and ends.

In a lecture, he contrasted Philip Larkin\u2019s poem \u201cAubade\u201d, in which death comes as something dark and absolute and life seems a trembling, fearful preparation for extinction, with Yeats\u2019s \u201cThe Cold Heaven\u201d, which allowed a rich dialogue between the ideas of life as a cornucopia and life as an empty shell. Heaney saw poetry itself, no matter what its content or tone, standing against the dull thought of life as a great emptiness. \u201cWhen a poem rhymes,\u201d Heaney wrote, \u201cwhen a form generates itself, when a metre provokes consciousness into new postures, it is already on the side of life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit.\u201dIn his 1991 collection Seeing Things he included a poem, \u201cFosterling\u201d, which seemed like a blueprint for how he himself might proceed, speaking of a \u201cheaviness of being\u201d producing \u201cpoetry / Sluggish in the doldrums of what happens\u201d. And then writing of a change which had come: \u201cMe waiting until I was nearly fifty / To credit marvels. Like the tree-clock of tin cans / The tinkers made. So long for air to brighten, / Time to be dazzled and the heart to lighten.\u201dThe blueprint, however, has turned out not to open the way for an easy lightness, or a tone of bright hope, in Heaney\u2019s work, but for a struggle that his poems would enact and dramatise between the facts as Larkin presents them in \u201cAubade\u201d and the idea, which Heaney proposes in his essay, that \u201cthe vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place\u201d.While his essay clearly comes down on one side, as does \u201cFosterling\u201d, the poems themselves have been more hushed in the presence of mortality, more open to the idea of loss as something pure. His poems have offered consolation or transformation only because they contain tones and phrases that are perfectly tuned; they are true to memory and loss, and thus somehow, at times miraculously, they offer a vision of what is beyond them or above them.In Human Chain, his best single volume for many years, and one that contains some of the best poems he has written, Heaney allows this struggle between the lacrimae rerum and the consolations of poetry to have a force which is satisfying because its result is so tentative and uncertain. Memory here can be filled with tones of regret and even undertones of anguish, but it also can appear with a sense of hard-won wonder. There is an active urge to capture the living breath of things, but he also allows sorrow into his poems.He uses a poetic line which sometimes seems complete and whole in its rhythm, and at others is stopped short, held, left hanging. It is as though to allow the rhythm its full completion would be untrue to the shape of the experience that gave rise to the poem, untrue to the terms of the struggle between the pure possibility that language itself can offer and a knowledge of the sad fixtures which the grim business of loss can provide.The verse structure Heaney seems most at home with here is the one most used in Seeing Things: it contains four stanzas of three lines per stanza, a sonnet without the couplet. This system offers a sort of looseness, a buoyancy, a refusal to close and conclude; it means that the endings of these poems can have a particular pathos, a holding of the breath, \u201cgleaning the unsaid off the palpable\u201d, as Heaney has it in his poem \u201cThe Harvest Bow\u201d.At times, despite his effort to be consoled, it is as though whatever is being remembered has taken all his heart for speech. This is most apparent in an elegy for the Irish singer David Hammond, which contains four of these three-line stanzas plus one extra line. It is the poem where the struggle between pure lament and the search for comfort in images seems most intense:\nThe door was open and the house was darkWherefore I called his name, although I knewThe answer this time would be silence\nThat kept me standing listening while it grewBackwards and down and out into the streetWhere as I\u2019d entered (I remember now)\nThe streetlamps too were out.\nIf there is a presiding spirit haunting this book, it is Virgil\u2019s Aeneid. In Stepping Stones, his book of interviews with Dennis O\u2019Driscoll, Heaney mentions that \u201cthere\u2019s one Virgilian journey that has indeed been a constant presence, and that is Aeneas\u2019s venture into the underworld. The motifs in Book VI have been in my head for years \u2013 the golden bough, Charon\u2019s barge, the quest to meet the shade of the father.\u201dHuman Chain is a book of shades and memories, of things whispered, of journeys into the underworld, of elegies and translations, of echoes and silences. It conjures up the ghosts of three painters \u2013 Colin Middleton, Nancy Wynne-Jones, Derek Hill \u2013 who spent their lives working with Irish light and Irish weather. The three-part poem \u201cChanson d\u2019Aventure\u201d, describing a journey by ambulance after suffering a stroke, invokes with gentle reverence John Keats, who wrote in a late poem of \u201cThis living hand, now warm and capable / of earnest grasping\u201d. Heaney describes:\nmy once capable\nWarm hand, hand that I could not feel you liftAnd lag in yours throughout that journeyWhen it lay flop-heavy as a bellpull\nThe most ambitious poem in the book is an ingenious and moving encounter with Book VI of the Aeneid, with a description of finding a used copy of the book in Belfast and taking it on Route 110 across Northern Ireland (\u201cCookstown via Toome and Magharafelt\u201d). Slowly the poem moves into the underworld (\u201cIt was the age of ghosts\u201d), where it meets, among others, Louis O\u2019Neill, one of the murdered dead in the Troubles, who is the subject of Heaney\u2019s earlier poem \u201cCasualty\u201d and wanders in a world of shady memory to emerge in a final poem about the birth of a first grandchild.Sometimes, it seems, it is enough for Heaney that he remembers. Throughout his career there have been poems of simple evocation and description. His refusal to sum up or offer meaning is part of his tact, but his skill at playing with rhythm, pushing phrases and images as hard as they will go, offers the poems an undertone, a gravity, a space between the words that allows them to soar or shiver.There is one poem, \u201cUncoupled\u201d \u2013 a diptych in memory of his parents \u2013 that has all the placid beauty of a Dutch painting or a Schubert song. Both parts of the poem are structured in the customary four three-line stanzas, both beginning with the same three words \u201cWho is this\u201d, both offering a single ghostly image from memory, something hovering between what is lost and what has now been found.The first part describes his mother carrying a tray of ashes from the house to the ash-pit; it offers a picture of immense, distant dignity, allowing the ashes to be \u201cwhitish dust and flakes still sparkling hot\u201d, purely themselves, but with all the resonance that they can command besides. The second part is a picture of his father \u201cnot much higher than the cattle / Working his way towards me through the pen, / His ashplant in one hand\u201d. The father is thus captured in an ordinary moment, but he is \u201cWaving and calling something I cannot hear\u201d because of\nall the lowing and roaring, lorries revvingAt the far end of the yard, the dealers\nShouting among themselves\nbut also, it is implied, because time has passed and death has intervened. In the last two lines \u2013 the last 20 words of the poem have each only one stark syllable \u2013 you watch Heaney struggling between the world of painful fact and something in his own imaginative spirit which insists that language used with sombre tact and care \u201copts for the condition of overlife and rebels at limit\u201d:\nSo that his eyes leave mine and I knowThe pain of loss before I know the term.\nColm T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s Brooklyn is published by Penguin.TopicsBooksBook of the weekPoetrySeamus HeaneyreviewsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: United AgentsLiterary agent Pat Kavanagh, Julian Barnes\u2019s wife, who died in 2008. Photograph: United AgentsBlake MorrisonWed 10 Apr 2013 22.08 AESTThere's a great passage in Tobias Wolff's autobiographical novel Old School, in which a pompous young teacher called Ramsey asks Robert Frost whether form really matters any\u00a0more: isn't writing that is spontaneous, even disorderly, a better way to reflect the traumas of modern-day experience? Frost's reply is devastating: \"I lost my nearest friend in the one they called the Great War. So\u00a0did Achilles lose his friend in war, and Homer did no injustice to his grief by writing about it\u00a0in dactylic hexameters \u2026 Such grief can only be\u00a0told in form \u2026 Without it you've got\u00a0nothing but a stubbed-toe cry \u2013 sincere, maybe, for what that's worth, but with no depth or carry. No\u00a0echo. You may have a grievance but\u00a0you do not have grief.\"Julian Barnes's new book is, in part,\u00a0about the grief he suffered (and continues to suffer) after the death of\u00a0his wife, the literary agent Pat Kavanagh, in 2008. On the matter of\u00a0form, he is with Frost, not Ramsey. If\u00a0it has taken him several years to express his grief in writing, whereas Joan Didion, for example, completed a\u00a0book about the death of her husband within 12 months, that's not because he was lost for words (he wrote hundreds of thousands of them in a\u00a0diary) but because he needed to find\u00a0the right form. His wife didn't enjoy public attention: a confessional memoir wouldn't have suited. The category-defying book he has written looks disjointed at first, until its different themes gradually converge.\"You put together two things that have not been put together before,\" it\u00a0begins, \"and the world is changed.\" That's true of love but also of art. Ezra\u00a0Pound made the combination of disparate things a principle of imagism, as in his poem on a station of the Paris M\u00e9tro: \"The apparition of these faces in the crowd:/Petals on a wet, black bough.\" Faces and petals make an immediate visual match. The themes that preoccupy Barnes \u2013 love and ballooning (and grief and photography) \u2013 take a little longer to line up but discovering how they do is half the pleasure. We've work to do \u2013 not grief\u2011work such as the author's, but work all the same.The book's first section offers a brief history of 19th-century Anglo-French ballooning, with the pioneer of aerial photography \u2013 Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Tournachon, aka Nadar \u2013 in the starring role. Just as every love story is a potential grief story, so every exultant balloon ascent is a potential disaster; as\u00a0well as freedom and adventure, there is hubris and farce. Nadar was doubly innovative: he didn't just get up in the clouds, colonising God's space, he took pictures, when all our\u00a0previous imagery had been Earthbound. It is the capacity \"to look at ourselves from afar, to make the subjective suddenly objective\" that Barnes admires in Nadar \u2013 that and the\u00a0fact he was \"uxorious\", a word he\u00a0returns to later and rescues from misuse in relation to himself.Two other pioneering balloonists were the English colonel Fred Burnaby and the French actor Sarah Bernhardt, both of them larger than life characters, despite Bernhardt being so slim. In the second section of the book, B & B are brought together. \"We may establish that they met,\" Barnes writes \u2013 \"establish\" as in build a story round, rather than base on fact. Soon they are soaring towards marriage. Or Burnaby imagines they are. Not that Bernhardt is merely flirting. But she is too busy having fun to want commitment. Rejected, he wonders if it isn't better to\u00a0live among clouds, deluded, than on\u00a0the level. \"The pain was to last several years.\"Burnaby died in 1885, in a battle in Sudan, from a spear-thrust through the neck. Barnes felt he had suffered a similar spear-thrust, or balloon crash, when his wife of 30 years died just 37\u00a0days after being diagnosed with a\u00a0brain tumour. Where the first two sections portray life in the air and on the ground, the searing 50-page essay that concludes the book describes descent \u2013 no upper air, no perspective, just darkness and despair. Nothing had prepared him: not his parents' deaths, nor all the thinking about death that went into his book Nothing to Be Frightened Of, published just a few months before. And very little helped him cope.Certain things that were said, or not said, only made it worse: the friends who suggest he get away while they look after his house and their dog has\u00a0the run of the garden (this while his wife is not yet dead); the ones who\u00a0pretend not to hear when he mentions\u00a0her name; the ones who ask \u2013 convinced he is looking better \u2013 \"Have you found someone?\" The griefstruck rarely know what they want, he says, so these offences are lightly noted, not raged over. What do they matter, after all \u2013 what does anything matter \u2013 when the worst has already happened?One by one, the classic consolations offered to the bereaved are considered and repudiated: that suffering makes you stronger; that things get easier after the first year, through repetition (\"why should repetition mean less pain?\"); that the two of you will be reunited in the next life (which no atheist can believe). He owns up to thoughts of suicide and explains the reason for resisting: he is his wife's chief rememberer, and if he kills himself he will be killing her too.One grief throws no light upon another, he says, quoting EM Forster. But some aspects of grief are universal, or can be made so through the honesty and precision with which they are articulated. Denying himself woolly comforts, Barnes scorns the euphemisms of \"passed\" or \"lost to cancer\" (the linguistic equivalent of averting one's eyes). Even actions that others might find strange \u2013 his habit of talking to his wife, though she is dead \u2013 have their own irresistible logic: \"the fact that someone is dead may mean that they are not alive, but doesn't mean that they do not exist.\"Pat Kavanagh was my agent for 30\u00a0years; it is hard for me to be objective. But this is not a book written\u00a0for people who knew her. Nor\u00a0is it \"Before She Left Me\", a story of her life and last weeks. Candid about\u00a0his own grief, Barnes remains protective of her privacy; though her photo is on the back cover, her name doesn't appear in\u00a0the text. Distressed by how many memories of her have gone, as if she is\u00a0slipping away a second time, he lists the things he does remember \u2013 the last\u00a0book she read, the last wine she drank, the last clothes she bought. But\u00a0he doesn't disclose what they were.\"Let me tell you something about her,\" he wrote of his wife in the half-chapter of A History of the World in 10\u00bd Chapters, while giving away very little. Levels of Life, similarly, is a book that levels with us only up to a point. Its resonance comes from all it doesn't say, as well as what it does; from the depth of love we infer from the desert of grief. Even this essay is only one panel of a triptych \u2013 a form arrived at to\u00a0\"give sorrow words\" when it might have been a mere stubbed-toe cry.TopicsJulian BarnesBiography booksreviewsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Author and activist Rebecca Solnit's answer is a triumphant \"yes\". She celebrates a history of political engagement over the past five decades and finds strong grounds for optimism, albeit sometimes in rather unexpected places (the invention of Viagra, she points out, has taken some of the heat off endangered species prized for their supposed aphrodisiac qualities).Charting recent breakthroughs - from the fall of the Berlin wall and the Zapatista uprising in Mexico, to the anti-globalisation demonstrations in Seattle and the worldwide marches against war in Iraq - Solnit explores the progression of social change and makes an inspiring, well-argued case for hope. Not hope \"like a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky\", but hope that means \"another world might be possible, not promised, not guaranteed. Hope calls for action; action is impossible without hope.\"But reflecting on the often underrated achievements of activists around the world, Solnit warns against the dangers of assuming that for every action, there is an equal, opposite and punctual reaction, and of regarding the lack of one as a failure: \"Cause and effect assumes history marches forward, but history is not an army. It is a crab scuttling sideways.\"This is a timely reminder. During many of the public meetings at which I've spoken since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, it has been suggested by a number of new but disillusioned activists that \"activism doesn't work\", that the anti-war marches had \"failed\" because the invasion went ahead. Challenging the expectation that change happens automatically and punctually is essential if we are to keep new campaigners motivated, politically engaged, and convinced of their ability to make a difference.Some of Solnit's writing is beautifully observed, like the wryly accurate portrait of activists who are so busy complaining about the problem that they fail to see the solution: \"Sometimes radicals settle for excoriating the wall for being so large, so solid, so blank, so without hinges, knobs, keyholes, rather than seeking a door, or they trudge through a door looking for a new wall\". But the book often seems to suffer from the same disorganisation she recognises as inherent in activism itself. Her examples are diverse, but often disjointed; she is overly reliant on the words of others, and arguments that have the potential to be rigorous all too often end in platitudes.Solnit's is an intensely personal account, a meditation on activism and hope - which is both the book's strength and its weakness. Her aim, she says, is to \"propose a new vision of how change happens\". This is an admirable goal, but she fails to offer a clear analysis of the most effective strategies for change.Her \"Angel of alternate history\" - based on the angel Clarence in Capra's classic film It's a Wonderful Life - describes what the world would be like if different activists hadn't been there and hadn't taken action: \"Most environmental victories look like nothing happened; the land wasn't annexed by the army, the mine didn't open, the road didn't get cut through, the factory didn't spew effluents that didn't give asthma to the children who didn't wheeze and panic and stay indoors on beautiful days.\"This is an inspiring vision, yet it risks defining activism as opposition. The real challenge for campaigners today is to be propositional - and as campaigns become more global, the challenges increase. \"Another world is possible\" is the rallying cry from the immensely popular World Social Forum movement. But it is much harder for hundreds of thousands of campaigners to agree on what that world might look like.If Solnit's work doesn't offer answers to that particular question, it none the less cheers us up as we struggle to find one.\u00b7 Caroline Lucas is Green party MEP for South-East England.TopicsBooksHigher educationGlobalisationPolitics booksreviewsReuse this contentEducationSchoolsTeachersUniversitiesStudentsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

She eavesdrops on America and a racism that has never gone away. Citizen won the National Book Critics Circle poetry award in the US in recognition, partly, of the shocking truth it tells. Through brief encounters and troubling retellings of recent news, Rankine puts one, as a white reader, on constant alert for any unconscious racism in oneself.Even the way the book has been published is bracingly correct. Rankine\u2019s Jamaican origins are withheld \u2013 no mention of her roots on the cover. Similarly, when she describes meeting a novelist in London, she does not reveal his provenance. She sees to it we take ourselves to task: why should we want\u00a0to know? Is it invariably a reflex\u00a0likely to lead to hasty stereotyping? I always want to know where a person comes from \u2013 a\u00a0journalist\u2019s weakness. But Rankine reminds us there is nothing black and\u00a0white about black and white.And there is nothing slight about the slights described here. They have the force of body blows. A scene on an\u00a0aeroplane is a particular shocker. It involves no noisy spoken insults but\u00a0the sickening, faux tact of a whispering mother who spares her daughter from having to sit next to a black passenger. If she is going to be racist, the mother knows she must be what she believes to be discreet. Perhaps the scene never happened (though I\u2019ll bet it did). Or perhaps it never happened to Rankine herself? There is no first person here, just a \u201cyou\u201d to keep things free. Once again, I\u00a0am conscious of the friction between my wish to pin things down and Rankine\u2019s to pull towards universality.But a need for specificity is satisfied in the horrific stories she tells of the racism suffered by tennis champion Serena Williams: \u201cNeither\u2026 God nor NIKE camp could shield her ultimately from people who felt her black body didn\u2019t belong on their court, in their world.\u201d She gives a powerful account of what Williams suffered at the hands of unsound umpires and a bigoted press. The question about whether \u2013 and how \u2013 to\u00a0speak out persists. There is an equally shocking piece about hurricane Katrina in which the emergency services are less than urgent. She reports that the lives of black people in the disaster were less\u00a0valued than those of the rescuers:\u00a0\u201cWhat I am hearing\u2026 is they\u00a0all\u00a0want to stay in Texas.\u201dThere is so much anger and anguish here that you wonder how it can be contained. But what is wonderful about Rankine\u2019s writing is that it works\u00a0like an out-of-body experience: she encounters her subject full-on and rises above it. And she never loses\u00a0her wide-angle reach. Above all, she shows how racism itself gets relegated. In a piece about Mark Duggan, killed by police in Tottenham in 2011, she describes meeting a novelist (the one mentioned earlier) in a house in Hackney. He has \u201cthe face of the English sky \u2013 full of weather, always in response, constantly shifting, clouding over only to clear\u201d. But they have the following exchange. He asks: \u201cWill you write about Duggan?\u201d She throws the question back: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d He says: \u201cMe?\u201d and looks \u201cslightly irritated\u201d.

Photograph: Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty Nicholas WroeFri 29 Jul 2011 19.25 AESTLike the cheesiest of summer teen movies, Michael Lewis's Moneyball tells a story of how the geeks and the freaks outsmarted the jocks. But rather than being set in a high school or summer camp, Lewis's 2003 piece of classic reportage treads rather less well-explored ground: behind the scenes in major league baseball. Baseball need defer to no sport in its claim to be the quintessential summer game. (Yes, yes, cricket. But while most of my childhood was indeed spent under an endlessly cloudless Swansea sky watching Glamorgan being pummelled by all-comers, there are equally vivid memories of freezing February nights listening on the radio as England were pummelled in all corners of the southern hemisphere.) By contrast, baseball is a purely April-to-September affair, with October ball only for those heroes who make the play-offs. It's played on sunny days and balmy nights and the fact that I read Moneyball during a baking July on Long Island, with the reassuring burble of baseball radio commentaries mingling with the hum of cicadas and whoops of frat boys, surely added to its allure. But that said, relatively little of Moneyball actually takes place outdoors on America's fields of dreams. More often the focus is on airless and strip-lit offices, deep beneath the grandstands, where a new breed of nerdy and statistically savvy baseball executives attempted to overturn a century and more of received wisdom as to how the game should be played. Lewis made his name as a writer about finance \u2013 or more accurately a writer about the personalities working in finance \u2013 with his 1989 debut Liar's Poker recounting his time as a bond salesman at Salomon Brothers. Last year his The Big Short provided the most entertaining and comprehensible explanation of the 2008 banking crisis. In a sense Moneyball is in this line, in that Lewis was first attracted to the story when he noticed that the unfashionable Oakland A's, despite operating on about a third of the budget of the New York Yankees and other big clubs, consistently outperformed much richer teams. What were Oakland doing to buck the market? Historically, baseball coaches had valued athleticism. They still do. They would be mad not to. But did they overvalue it? From the bedsit and campus computers of maths students who played fantasy baseball \u2013 a game in which real on-field events are translated into points \u2013 came the heretical realisation that some players, while not as traditionally elegant or as fast or as strong as the standard model, were nevertheless highly effective in some important aspect of the game. Such was the weight of accumulated industry wisdom, and the size of the resultant blind spot that had built up over the years in the eyes of coaches and scouts, these players were significantly undervalued. The Oakland A's \u2013 led by their, inevitably, charismatic and maverick manager Billy Beane \u2013 were the first team to recruit stats experts to their scouting staff and so exploit this inefficiency in the market and demonstrate the subtitle of Lewis's book: \"The Art of Winning an Unfair Game\". Just how Oakland succeeded is a fascinating story: part thriller, part-family saga, brilliantly told. You do not need to know or care about baseball \u2013 though I defy you not to be smitten after reading the book \u2013 because like all good sports books, it is not really about sport, or even in this case about applied statistics. It is about people. Specifically the oddball group of irregulars Beane gathered together who emerge as Hogarthian eccentrics: the hitter so fat \"if you put him in corduroys, he'd start a fire\"; the pitcher whose action was so distorted that he regularly grazed his knuckles in the dirt as he threw. Nick Hornby said he understood only one word in four of the baseball talk, yet still called it \"the best and most engrossing sports book I have reads in years\". Since the publication of Moneyball the Oakland personnel, and their ideas, have spread out across the league and their methods assimilated into mainstream thinking. The market corrected itself and the A's are again struggling against the weight of financial imbalance. But just as Billy Beane and his cohorts proved that all baseball stars having to play the same way \"is as absurd as insisting that all writers should write like John Updike\", Moneyball shows that a book about misshapen athletes and introvert statisticians needn't necessarily be excluded from the sand and suntan oil treatment. And, yes, it has just been made into movie slated for release this autumn starring Brad Pitt and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I'm telling you now that it won't be as good as the book.TopicsSummer readingSummer readingsSport and leisure booksSummer reading 2011blogpostsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

When he writes \"a glass of beer\" we do not just see it; we are willing to drink from it vicariously. The ballooning accident (imaginatively derived from footage of an actual incident) that opens Enduring Love is a spectacular example, but the ability to make the invented seem real animates every page of his work. The novels' psychological acuity derives, always, from their fidelity to a precisely delineated reality. Needless to say, the more disturbing or skewed that reality (in the early stories and novels, most obviously), the more finely McEwan attunes his readers to it. Moral ambiguity and doubt are thereby enhanced - rather than resolved - by clarity of presentation. This is why the themes of the novels (with the exception of the enjoyably forgettable Amsterdam ) linger and resonate beyond the impeccable neatness of their arrangement. McEwan is, in other words, a thoroughly traditional original.\nAtonement does not feel, at first, like a book by McEwan. The opening is almost perversely ungripping. Instead of the expected sharpness of focus, the first 70 or so pages are a lengthy summary of shifting impressions. One longs for a cinematic clarity and concentration of dialogue and action, but such interludes dissolve before our - and the participants' - eyes. Unlike Martin Amis, say, or Salman Rushdie, McEwan is an invisible rather than a flamboyant stylist. Even so, the pallid qualifiers and disposable adverbs (a \"gently rocking\" sheet of water, the \"coyly drooping\" head of a nettle) come as a surprise. The language used to distil the scene - a gathering of the Tallis family at their country house on a sweltering day in 1935 - serves also as a wash that partially obscures it. Various characters come and go but the novel, at this point, seems populated mainly by its literary influences. Chief among these is Virginia Woolf. The technique is not stream of consciousness so much as \"a slow drift of association\", \"the hovering stillness of nothing much seeming to happen\". The book later contains a critique of its own early pages - or at least of the draft from which they derive - in the guise of a letter from Cyril Connolly, editor of Horizon , who advises that \"such writing can become precious when there is no sense of forward movement\". The requisite propulsion is provided by the unexpected intrusion, as it were, of two other novelists from the interwar years. Cecilia, the eldest daughter of the family in whose house we are imaginatively lodged, was at Cambridge with Robbie, the son of the Tallises' cleaning lady, whose education was funded by Cecilia's father. They become aware, on this sultry day, of some kind of current - animosity? irreconcilable attraction? - passing between them. Robbie tries to articulate this in a letter, at the bottom of which he scribbles the naked truth: \"In my dreams I kiss your cunt.\" He discards that draft and intends to send another, blander one but, in keeping with Freud's analysis of such slips, accidentally sends the shocking letter to Cecilia via her adolescent sister, Briony, who opens and reads it. The consequences of the go-between blundering in like this are liberating and incriminating in unequal measure. What Lawrence called the \"dirty little secret\" of sex besmirches the Tallises' world, or - as Lawrence insisted - reveals how besmirched that world really is. It is as if Mellors from Lady Chatterley's Lover has gatecrashed the exquisitely rendered world of Mrs Dalloway . Or as if the contents of McEwan's stories had been explicitly daubed on the walls of Brideshead. Another crisis soon follows, this one imported from EM Forster's India. Cecilia's young cousin, Lola, is sexually assaulted in the grounds of the house. Lola does not know by whom, but Briony - an aspiring writer - compounds her earlier transgression by convincing her and everyone else (except Cecilia) that Robbie is the culprit. Unlike the incident in the Marabar caves, this one does not end in a retraction and Robbie, the proletarian interloper, is convicted. In the second section of the novel, the pastel haze of the first part gives way to an acrid, graphic account of Robbie's later experiences in the British rout at Dunkirk. McEwan is here playing more obviously to his strengths. The highly decorated novelist deploys his research in an effective if familiar pattern of narrative manoeuvres. Refracted through Robbie's exhausted, wounded view of history in the making, the retreat unfolds in a series of vividly realised details and encounters. In the atrocious context of battle, Briony's apparently motiveless crime is rendered almost insignificant. \"But what was guilt these days? It was cheap. Everyone was guilty, and no one was.\" In similar fashion, the partial democratisation of Britain that results from the social upheaval of war is prefigured by Cecilia's turning her back on her family and allying herself with Robbie, the working-class graduate (whose smouldering sense of grievance and displacement would be vehemently embodied on the postwar stage by Jimmy Porter). Part three shifts back to London, where Briony is training as a nurse, struggling to cope with the influx of casualties from Dunkirk. McEwan's command of visceral shock is here anchored in a historical setting thoroughly authenticated by his archival imagination. The elliptical style of the opening part has no place in these pages, as the graphic horrors of injury, mutilation and death pile up before Briony's eyes. She loosens the bandage around a patient's head and his brain threatens to slop out into her hands. Does this devotion to the victims of war wash her hands of her earlier guilt? Does her atonement depend on Robbie's survival? Or can it be achieved through the eventual realisation of her literary ambitions - through a novel such as the one we are reading? Who can grant atonement to the novelist, whose God-like capacity to create and rework the world means that there is no higher authority to whom appeal can be made? It is a tribute to the scope, ambition and complexity of Atonement that it is difficult to give an adequate sense of what is going on in the novel without preempting - and thereby diminishing - the reader's experience of it. Suffice to say, any initial hesitancy about style - any fear that, for once, McEwan may not be not in control of his material -all play their part in his larger purpose. On the one hand, McEwan seems to be retrospectively inserting his name into the pantheon of British novelists of the 1930s and 1940s. But he is also, of course, doing more than this, demonstrating and exploring what the mature Briony comes to see as a larger \"transformation... being worked in human nature itself\". The novels of Woolf and Lawrence did not just record this transformation; they were instrumental in bringing it about. McEwan uses his novel to show how this subjective or interior transformation can now be seen to have interacted with the larger march of 20th- century history. While John Fowles was working on The French Lieutenant's Woman, he reminded himself that this was not a book that one of the Victorian novelists forgot to write but, perhaps, one that they had failed to write. A similar impulse underwrites Atonement. It is less about a novelist harking nostalgically back to the consoling uncertainties of the past than it is about creatively extending and hauling a defining part of the British literary tradition up to and into the 21st century.TopicsBooksFictionIan McEwanreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The gay hero, Nick Guest, is on his way to a blind date but is waylaid by his land-lady's daughter, a highly strung neurotic with a history of self-harm. Smartly assuming control of the situation, Nick relieves her of the contents of the cutlery drawer, and chivalrously holds her hand until she calms down. This touching scene is unlikely to have occurred in one of Hollinghurst's previous books: first because there were few women in them; and second because nothing would be allowed to get in the way of a passage of graphic gay sex.Hollinghurst's debut novel, The Swimming Pool Library (1988), was lauded for its startling conflation of high literary style and low-rent sex, and presented an eye-opening trawl through the London gay scene, from private clubs to public toilets, in the laconic tone of a latter-day Henry James. The Line of Beauty is not a sequel as such, but picks up where the earlier narrative broke off, in August 1983: \"the last summer of its kind there was ever to be\".If The Swimming Pool Library was the party novel, The Line of Beauty deals with the inevitable hangover. Aids was never even alluded to in the earlier novel; here it ominously clouds the narrative. And those readers who admire Holling-hurst's style but weary of his sex drive (even the Gay Times condemned the erotic passages of his previous book as \"selfish\" and \"dull\") will be pleased to discover it is a work of social nuance rather than sexual urgency. And for once, the wider political context is embraced rather than ignored - not only is Mrs Thatcher a pervasive influence throughout, she even puts in a personal appearance.Although the book takes time to explore Hollinghurst's principal obsessions with Eros and aesthetics, its main theme is the climate of giddy success among well-to-do Tories between the electoral victories of 1983 and 1987. \"The 80s are going on for ever,\" declares one character blithely, while a typically self-serving civil servant sums up the mood in Whitehall: \"The economy's in ruins, no one's got a job, and we just don't care, it's bliss.\"Gerald Fedden has just entered Parliament, hotly tipped as ministerial material, and is determined to fulfil two major political ambitions - to have a latex likeness on Spitting Image and to host the Lady at home for supper. Gerald's ignominious fall precludes the puppet, but the PM's visit is the highlight of his career. It's also one of several outstanding social set-pieces within the book, when, having teased the reader with various hints and glimpses, Hollinghurst finally ushers her on in a lavishly embroidered jacket, which prompts Gerald's rebellious daughter to waspishly remark that \"she looks like a country and western singer\".The Line of Beauty is a novel of eventful gatherings rather than propulsive action, and in these situations Hollinghurst proves to be one of the sharpest observers of privileged social groupings since Anthony Powell. Perhaps it is in homage to A Dance to the Music of Time that he calls his ambient narrator Nick, while the surname Guest alludes to his ambiguous status as a tolerated interloper - an Oxford friend of the Feddens' son, who rents a room in the family's Notting Hill home.Despite the fact that the Feddens host private recitals in the drawing room and keep a Guardi above the mantelpiece, they are fundamentally philistines, for whom art is a means of social advancement. Nick, meanwhile, is an unattached aesthete searching for an outlet for his sensibility. At first he makes half-hearted progress on a thesis about Henry James, but later he floats into the orbit, and bedroom, of Wani Ouradi, a glamorous Lebanese heir to a supermarket fortune, with whom he formulates vague plans to found a production company.With characteristic pretension, Nick takes the company name, Ogee, from the sinuous double curve cited by Hogarth as the \"line of beauty\", though Nick's favoured example of the form in nature is the point at which a man's lower back cleaves to his bottom. Not surprisingly, the venture fails to inspire much confidence in his parents, for whom \"being sort-of the art adviser on a non-existent magazine was as obscure and unsatisfactory as being gay\". Nor does it impress the principal underwriter, Wani's father, a spectacularly vulgar Lebanese grocer who tellingly mishears the word as \"orgy\".The Ogee organisation is in fact no more than a rich boy's distraction - part production company, part publishing house, but really no more than a nebulous excuse for its directors to Hoover up vast quantities of cocaine. If Hollinghurst's previous novel, The Spell (1998), was the slightly embarrassing story of a last-ditch, middle-aged dalliance with ecstasy, The Line of Beauty is a sour celebration of the drug that kept the economy booming: \"Nick loved the etiquette of the thing, the chopping with a credit card, the passing of the rolled note, the procedure courteous and dry, 'all done with money', as Wani said.\"Unfortunately, the illicit glamour of these scenes wears off as quickly as the drug itself, to the point where the incessant snorting takes over from the sex as the most mechanically repetitive element of Hollinghurst's writing. And when he chances to write about drugs and sex together, the outcome is dire: \"Tristao bent to snort his line, and Wani felt his cock and Nick felt his arse\" is as impoverished a sentence as you will find in any novel, literary or otherwise.But The Line of Beauty is a long book, and even if you skip the sex and the snorting there's plenty left to enjoy. For the first time, there is a clear sense that Hollinghurst has extended his powers to create a universe rather than a clique; and though it adopts a highly privileged perspective, the novel has sufficient breadth to evoke the full social spectrum of 1980s Britain - gay and straight, rich and poor. Ogee ogee ogee, oi oi oi.TopicsBooksFictionAlan HollinghurstThe Line of BeautyreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Eamonn McCabe for the GuardianKate ClanchyThu 14 May 2015 15.30 AESTLast modified on Fri 23 Feb 2018 00.00 AEDTAnne Enright\u2019s new book, the blurb tells us, is set around an enticing moment: matriarch Rosaleen Madigan calling together her grown-up children to discuss the selling of the family house. Families and their particular unhappinesses; Ireland and her madness; houses and inheritance \u2013 the very stuff of novels. We anticipate character arcs and plot lines steaming out from the will-making with all the coal-fired, piston-pumping energy of Bleak House.But The Green Road is nothing like that. Rosaleen is certainly a fine specimen of matriarchal monster, but she doesn\u2019t get round to the summoning of offspring, let alone the disbursement, until more than halfway through the book. The first part is instead given over to separate episodes in the lives of the four children, each spaced widely from the next, like lights on the long country road of the title.We begin with Hanna, 12, wandering round her home town in County Clare in 1980 and trying to bridge, on foot and in her mind, the gap between her Granny Madigan in an unheated smallholding straight from JM Synge, and the modernity of her uncle Bart Considine\u2019s chemist\u2019s shop, where \u201cbottom cream\u201d is dispensed and requests for condoms are smugly refused. The two sides of the family are long estranged: \u201cGrandfather Madigan was shot during the civil war and their Grandfather Considine refused to help. The men ran to the Medical Hall looking for ointment and bandages and he just pulled down the blind.\u201d Hanna\u2019s oldest brother, Dan, is all set to be a priest at this point, but when we join him in 1991 in New York, he has metamorphosed into \u201cIrish Dan\u201d: mercurially reciting Yeats to a table of gay men, deftly and cruelly moving through and out of the charged dramas of the Aids epidemic.Six years later, Dan\u2019s loved and despised sister Constance is called in for a mammogram, and drives herself along the \u201cgreen road\u201d to hospital. As in her earlier novel The Forgotten Waltz, Enright casually and superbly evokes the changes that came to Ireland in the 90s, exemplified in this instance by Constance\u2019s brash husband and his family: \u201cShe passed the latest McGrath house: Dessie\u2019s brother the auctioneer\u2019s, who had built a bungalow, high off the road.\u201d But Enright also weaves in something new, here and throughout the book: a thread of flaming, elemental Irish romanticism. Constance continues: \u201cThe slope of raw clay had been ablaze, when her father passed along that way, with red poppies and with those yellow flowers that love broken ground.\u201d Constance thinks briefly of middle brother Emmet, \u201cback from Africa, or wherever, with a scraggy beard and hundred yard stare\u201d, and in 2002 in Mali we catch up with him, trying to balance the demands of starving children and a needy dog; of his sentimental, lovable girlfriend Alice and his terrible drive to do good.Enright wrote short stories before she wrote novels, and each of these chapters is something like one, though of an unusually lengthy, majestic sort. Each takes place in its own fully realised, strikingly sensual world. Each has a separate narratorial voice: just behind Constance\u2019s shoulder in her chapter; chilly with irony for Emmet; and in Dan\u2019s section, an observing and desiring \u201cwe\u201d that speaks for the gay community. Enright does not try to link the tales in any conventional manner: the siblings think of each other only glancingly; and Constance doesn\u2019t tell us, for instance, when or how Dan gave up the priesthood, though we thirst to know. Any one of these episodes could be read separately, in short, for the wit or the pleasures of the deft prose; but it is part of the miracle of this novel that the stories seem, nevertheless, powerfully part of each other.How has this been achieved? Perhaps it is simply that the characters are so finely realised that they seem continuous: we feel the pressures on Emmet as coming from the long past, part of the air he breathes; we understand that the absence of all three of Constance\u2019s siblings is an unspoken part of her homemaking; most extraordinary of all, we experience Dan\u2019s gaps and distance as part of his character, his distance from himself. It is not much like a novel, but it is a lot like knowing people; an awful lot like being alive.A return to the western shore: Anne Enright on yielding to the Irish traditionRead moreThe novel-ish crisis does finally arrive, as such moments do in life, and is heralded with declarations and plane journeys and massive shopping sprees; and passes with a fine display of compulsive bad behaviour, flummery and policemen. When it is over the Madigan siblings have, in a novel-like manner, gained some wisdom. But no one, least of all Rosaleen, can be tucked into an arc in this book; only minor characters are allowed a resolution, and that a brief one, on Facebook.The episodic, trailing, unclosed ending is perhaps the most brilliant part of this brilliant, devastating, radical novel. Nothing is settled; no one is improved: life and character are as provisional, as mysterious and as rich as they seemed to Hanna at the beginning of the journey, when she walked down the road looking into the windows, each with its \u201cown decoration and its own version of curtains or blinds: a sailboat made of polished horn, a cream tureen with plastic flowers in it, a pink felted plastic cat\u201d. This is not a book about houses, however lovingly Enright evokes them; it is a book about the road: the green road across the Burren, \u201cthe most beautiful road in the world, bar none\u201d \u2013 the road to the sea.

One feared a trough of plaint: either a sad, Gosse-like reckoning with the father; or an angry, journalistic reckoning with those journalists who have hunted Amis from tooth to tooth. But Experience is not quite a memoir, nor is it quite a portrait of his father, nor is it really an autobiography. It is an escape from memoir; indeed, an escape into privacy. In the very book which might, at first glance, seem most exhibitionist, most shamelessly metropolitan, Amis has softly retreated to the provinces of himself.His book often reads like a letter to his family and closest friends. It is sometimes embarrassing to read; the ordinary reader feels voyeuristic, at times almost uninvited, but very moved. What seems at first just gossip and guestlists - sprays of names offered without explanation, diaristic footnotes, a refusal to universalise - soon becomes a kind of tender defiance, as if Amis wanted the book to vibrate with an atmosphere of wounded privacy. Thus Experience has an undulating, open-ended form, something like a notebook whose pagination has been erased. Obvious chronology is scrambled, so that at any page or two we might move from the mid-1990s back to Amis's earliest childhood days, forward to the 1970s, then forward to the moment at which Amis is writing the book itself, and so on. The book's reminds us that, in an inversion of the usual adage, life is lived backwards but is thought forwards. For we are always thinking forwardly: what next?; yet more often than not what comes next has already been decided by the court of our past, so we must live backwardly. Amis's book is imbued with this sense of the past, especially childhood, as a future already determined. One such determinism - it is the book's major theme - is that innocence will necessarily become experience, song turn to growl. This will happen gradually, as life teaches us its experience. But, as Amis describes it, that change happened savagely and very quickly to him, in 1994 and 1995. These years are the book's pregnable pivot, the wound to which the text recurs again and again.In 1994, Amis learned that his cousin, Lucy Partington, who had disappeared in 1973, was one of Frederick West's victims. He grieved, and grieves, for his cousin, and some of the book's loveliest passages evoke her, and childish holidays spent with her on the beach in Wales. The Partington family were innocence, while the Amises were experience. The Partingtons were from the village, the Amises were from town, and when the families met, \"the lion lay down with the lamb\". (Echoes of Milton and Blake on innocence and experience.) Also around this time, Amis lost an old friend (Julian Barnes), an old agent (Pat Kavanagh), separated from his wife and two children, became horribly famous for his teeth (not, of course, the extraction of a few molars, but the reconstruction of his entire jaw), and lost his father, who died in November, 1995. He also learned that he was the father of a 17-year-old daughter, Delilah Seale, whom he had never met. Amis did not really collapse so much as die into middle age. Innocence had been vandalised. His tears, as the Psalmist has it, had become his meat, day and night. These experiences are wrought in a rich and sedimented prose that displays all of Amis's usual powers of nimble paradox (a chemist that smelled of \"decaying penicillin\", a tennis court strewn with \"shop-fresh garbage\"), with wonderful plumage and peacockery: his head, during toothache, \"TV-shaped with swellings\", or the delicious sentence used to describe his father's stately, plump fall on the Edgware Road: \"It was a work of colossal administration.\"Yet as the book describes Kingsley's last days in hospital, Amis knows how to dilute his tangs, and let a flatter, harder prose report the inevitable: \"How hard it is to die. You have to chase it, panting.\" And finally, this bony epitaph, as Martin looks at his father's corpse: \"It is 1995 and he has been there since 1949.\" What is so moving is the rightful selfishness of those dates: he does not write \"since 1922\", which would be Kingsley's birthdate, but \"since 1949\", which is his own - for his is the reality that now matters. The book's oblique patterns educate us in the ways that the past contains the seeds of its future. For instance, we read of Kingsley Amis's divorce from Martin's mother, and Kingsley's second divorce from Martin's stepmother; we already know, because of the book's switchback form, that Martin's divorce will follow many years later. Likewise, in the course of the book, a daughter is lost (the Partingtons' daughter) and a daughter found (Delilah Seale), and a daughter birthed (his baby daughter with his new wife, Isabel Fonseca). And a father is lost, while a father-substitute (Saul Bellow) is found. And through it all, the fearful symmetry of father and son: one writer begetting another. This layering of incident allows Amis, most beautifully, to touch the hems of his themes without dragging too strongly on them. When, for instance, Martin regrets that he lost touch with his stepmother after her divorce from Kingsley, he laments \"our vanished relatedness, cancelled by law but not by feeling\". Yet that tiny elegy speaks forward too, perhaps, to another, later vanished relatedness, that between Martin and his first wife, Antonia Phillips. There is a sense in which Amis is continually speaking through people to other people in this book, a sun happy to be outshone by their moons. This self-dimming is something new and unexpected in his work, and suggests a new emotional climate. As Nabokov does in his memoir, Speak, Memory, so Amis buries his patterns deep in the aesthetic textures of his book. At one point, he tells us that a local Italian restaurant serves a dish which might be translated as \"from grandmother's handbag\". There is a joke that one might as well fancy \"a plate of hairgrips and DentuFix\". The book has, not surprisingly, established teeth as one of its themes of hardship: there is a funny riff about the indignity of Martin's having to buy Steradent for his dentures. Thus \"Dentufix\". But why \"hairgrips\"?Seventy-four pages later, we learn in a footnote that Lucy Partington's body was found with rope, packing tape, and \"two hairgrips\". So a plate of \"hairgrips and DentuFix\" is, essentially, a plate of experience, a plate of pain. From such painful, painstaking pebbles, such subtleties of detail and implication, is this fine, affecting book built.TopicsBiography booksMartin AmisreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Netsuke are toggles used to attach a carrying pouch to traditional Japanese garments.\nPhotograph: Martin Argles for the GuardianVeronica HorwellSat 26 Jun 2010 09.04 AESTThe porcelain of the potter Edmund de Waal doesn't usually stand solitary in a glass case or alone on a table. His pieces are often grouped as families on shelves or in niches, as in the new ceramics galleries at the V&A, where they talk among themselves and hold converse with the space they're living in: its past, its associations, the qualities of its light. Sometimes they look like the stacked contents of a cooled kiln, waiting for the selection to reject the misfires; or survivors retrieved from a cargo long sunk on its voyage back from the Far East. De Waal barely mentions his pots in this unique memoir of his family, though. They're present as an absence, the vocation he evaded for a couple of years while he researched how he came to inherit a collection of 264 netsuke from his great-uncle Iggie.Netsuke seem the opposite of frangible porcelain. They were carved in finegrained wood or ivory to reward touch and endure wear while doing their job, as the toggle on a cord from which a container was slung, most often for medicine or tobacco. A man in traditional Japan tucked the cord behind his obi-sash, and the netsuke prevented it from slipping out. Private satisfaction and public display contended in them, as it does in many small, personal objects. Some were carved by great craftsmen, some by gifted amateurs; all held forever a moment of time \u2013 the twist of a tiger's shoulders, the twitch of a hare's head.De Waal's intent in studying the collection was to use their acquisition by Charles Ephrussi, a cousin of his great-grandfather, to understand the first wave of Japonisme as it surged through Paris in the 1870s. (De Waal has the credentials, years studying Japanese aesthetics.) But that proved too narrow a subject. He came to want to hear the dialogue between all the possessions of Charles, wealthy son of a pan-European Jewish dynasty of grain brokers and bankers who had migrated from Odessa on the Black Sea. He needed to know how Charles had educated himself in art \u2013 Charles first wrote for, then became proprietor of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts magazine; how Charles evolved his taste from tourist souvenirs, albeit the grandest ones, to the purchase of lacquer, and bold commissions of his friends, the Impressionists. Charles paid Manet so amply for a painting of a bundle of asparagus that, a week later, Manet delivered an extra canvas with a single stalk, and the note: \"This seems to have slipped from the bundle.\" Recognise the story? Proust borrowed it. Charles became one of the models for Swann in In Search of Lost Time, although by the year Proust began to write that, Charles had moved on from Japan, his passion for which had been intertwined with his relationship with his netsuke-collecting mistress. They had exhibited their treasures together \u2013 there's Parisian sexual daring.De Waal moderates the exchanges between art and life (the back of Charles's top hat, so out of place, in Renoir's informal canvas, The Boating Party Lunch; the anger of Renoir when Charles bought an auric Moreau painting, which Renoir regarded as a Jewish lapse of taste), and explores as close as he can get to Charles's apartment, its contents and their meaning. A sure way to retrieve lost time, or at least to feel that retrieval is possible, is to make contact with the dead fingers that left their impressions on what they created, and with the eyes and hands that appreciated that creation. De Waal has a mystical ability to so inhabit the long-gone moment as to seem to suspend inexorable history, personal and impersonal.A lot happens next \u2013 that's what stories are for \u2013 but none of it seems inevitable. Charles on a whim gave the netsuke, and the vitrine that was their glass carapace, as a wedding present to his cousin Viktor, who married the Baroness Emmy Schey von Koromla in 1899. They were shipped to the marble burg of the Palais Ephrussi in Vienna, and being too intimate for its salons, were stashed in Emmy's dressing room. She made up stories about the netsuke as her children took them out for play, but otherwise they remained undisturbed for almost 40 years, while the Austro-Hungarian emperor died and his empire evaporated. Viktor and Emmy, confident in assimilation \u2013 his Russianness was vestigial, their Jewishness marginal \u2013 had invested in that empire and lost much of their fortune, but they lived on diminished in the palais. The paintings and miscellanea, no longer supplemented with fresh-bought excitements, barring Viktor's choice books, solidified into a family heritage.The central passage of this narration is overwhelming. Emmy's daughter Elisabeth fought her way through university to become a lawyer, then escaped Vienna to study further before a marriage to a Dutch businessman; son Iggie, in pursuit of a minor talent for couture, and a major discovery about his sexuality, slipped away to Paris, then America. They travelled light to their future lives, assured that all the familiar things remained in their remembered places back in the old home, the ivory rats set out in the vitrine; while their parents were immobilised by those same things, withdrawn from the thickening, darkening public world of Austria after Hitler's rise into what seemed safe domestic space, the silver calm in its room, the rare books wise in their locked case. We all know the dates, and events on those dates, yet De Waal's description of the Anschluss and after comes as an absolute shock: the palais breached by night, the initial smash and grabs. Then, by many methodical days, the inventories, as the Property Transactions Office sent in its appraisal valuation official to divest Viktor and Emmy of everything from the ownership of the Ephrussi bank to a bundle of umbrellas. Viktor and Emmy left with two suitcases for the limbo of a country estate in a Slovakia that no longer existed, and half their little luggage was confiscated on the way. Emmy committed discreet suicide; Elisabeth, by now a bicycling, observant Christian bringing up her own children in Tunbridge Wells, extricated her father. He arrived with the key to his case of books \u2013 all Aryanised by diktat into Austrian libraries \u2013 on his watchchain, and not much more.And the netsuke? That's De Waal's revelation, the \"hidden inheritance\". Anna, who for decades was Emmy's personal maid (no other details specified), was suborned by the Nazi asset strippers to crate up the Ephrussi household goods. Allowed to dwell on in her servant's chamber, she pilfered the netsuke \u2013 so portable they could be slipped in an apron pocket one at a time \u2013 until she had stolen them all away, and bedded them down in her straw palliasse. Postwar, Elisabeth reached a wrecked Vienna to retrieve any morsels of what had been home, to find the palais had been a Nazi, then a US occupation, office. The Americans reunited her with Anna, who returned all 264 netsuke in an attach\u00e9 case, and dematerialised from the story. Elisabeth, who was De Waal's grandmother, gave them to Iggie, thereby making up his mind to take up a business appointment in despoiled Japan. Iggie made his life there, installed the netsuke in a wall case in Tokyo, and found his true partner, a young Japanese man who inherited the netsuke at Iggie's death, and passed them back to De Waal at his own.That had to be told because this story compels telling; but it is such a bald summary of a work that succeeds in several known genres: as family memoir, travel literature (De Waal's Japan is the nearest thing to being there, and over decades), essays on migration and exile, on cultural misperceptions, and on De Waal's attempt to define his relationship with his own kaolin creations. His book is also a new genre, unnamed and maybe unnameable. A thing-book, perhaps, or a Wunderkammer \u2013 cabinet of marvels \u2013 except they're both such German concepts.The netsuke, and other works of art and craft gained and lost along the way, never serve merely as accessories, trophies or substitutes for their owners and looters, but retain their own secret identities, and hold within them, as they always will, the time of their creation; both the moment they show \u2013 that hare with his front feet so briefly lofted off the ground \u2013 and the many, many hours of their manufacture. If you have ever cleared a house after a death you will recognise this feeling, that each handmade thing matters of itself, even when mortality casts it loose sequentially from maker and owners; the sense that responsibility for the present of an object is also a duty to its past, and an obligation to its onward transmission.What happened to the hare with amber eyes, and the carved medlar that almost felt as if it might squish when handled, after their return from Japan? De Waal bought them a secondhand vitrine from the V&A and set it up in his London house, its door unlocked so his own children could play with its contents. \"Objects have always been . . . stolen, retrieved and lost. It is how you tell their stories that matters.\" He has told their story wonderfully. Oh, and this is a beautiful and unusual book, as a physical object. Somebody really cared.TopicsBooksBook of the weekBiography booksArt and design booksHistory booksEdmund de WaalThe Hare with Amber EyesreviewsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Bettmann/CorbisThe ancient Greek tale of Daedalus and Icarus \u2026 a familial theme that runs through Bechdel's graphic novel. Photograph: Bettmann/CorbisJess SutcliffeSat 28 Dec 2013 19.30 AEDTThe concept of a comforting read takes me straight back to times of childhood illness; cuddled up with a duvet and a dog on the sofa with a pile of Asterix or Tintins within easy reach; probably next to the saucepan my parents had sacrificed as a sick bucket. Now when I am ill, upset or feeling particularly homesick, my immediate response is to reach for the expressive pictures and witty dialogue of a comic or graphic novel. And, while Asterix, Obelix, Dogmatix, Getafix and Vitalstatistix will forever have a place in my heart, in recent years I've fallen for a wider range of graphic novels.My current comfort-blanket of choice is Alison Bechdel's \"tragicomic\", Fun Home. A million miles away from the light-hearted adventures of my Gaulish twosome, Bechdel's graphic memoir is a witty, melancholic and endearing insight into grief, sexuality and a search for happiness. Whilst this might not strike you as immediately comforting, the combination of image and word is transporting.Taking the reader back through her remembered childhood, Bechdel offers us not simply a furtive peek through the keyhole, but a fully-fledged cut-away of her life. She lays out her faltering relationship with her father, the breakdown of her parents' marriage and her own explorations of sexuality on the page in glorious illustrations. The title's \"fun home\" refers to the family funeral parlour where her father worked and is an appropriate setting for Bechdel's investigation of loss and grief. Her father dominates the novel as Bechdel traces the intertwined threads of her life: their father-daughter relationship, her homosexuality, her father's closeted homosexuality and his death.Their relationship is close but \"not close enough\", as Bechdel writes, and their interactions are often painfully poignant and carefully linked. The story of Daedalus and Icarus runs throughout, connecting the opening frame of Icarian games with the closing image of the author as a child jumping into the arms of her father. Both are visual interpretations of treasured memories I share with my own Pa. Despite their particularity, Bechdel's struggles have a resonance for anyone dealing with family life, which makes Fun Home both comforting and startling in its honesty.Bechdel's use of literature adds a depth to the text that plays beautifully with its light-hearted observational elements. Oscar Wilde gets a shout-out, with The Importance of Being Ernest taking centre stage in a chapter remembering Bechdel's mother's acting endeavours. The Odyssey and James Joyce's Ulysses both have a strong presence, and there is a sense that these works have played an important part in informing Bechdel's understanding of life.My favourite pages recall a conversation between Bechdel and her father in the car on the way to the cinema. The panels are 12 to a page, choppy and brief, emphasising the claustrophobia of awkward, stilted communication in a moving vehicle. Their conversation is based around a previously illustrated event \u2013 the gift of a book with obvious homosexual themes \u2013 and the halting, confessional dialogue is interspersed with Bechdel's own reflection: \"I kept still, like he was a splendid deer I didn't want to startle.\" Bechdel's coming-of-age in both an artistic and a sexual sense is closely personal and as a reader I feel almost privileged to be privy to her tale. At the same time, the heartrending humanity of the novel is a comforting reminder that life is horrible, hard but often beautiful.Honest, heart-breaking and often hilarious, what I find most comforting about Fun Home is that in Bechdel I have found someone else who defines their life through literature. Someone else, I like to imagine, who would turn to a book when they're tucked up in bed feeling sorry for themselves. I really hope she doesn't have a TV.TopicsBooksComfort readingComics and graphic novelsAlison BechdelblogpostsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Three Lions/Getty ImagesA patient receiving treatment for breast cancer in 1955. Photograph: Three Lions/Getty ImagesAlexander LinklaterSun 23 Jan 2011 11.05 AEDTThree quarters of the way through his \"biography\" of cancer, the New York-based oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee pauses to set the scene in his laboratory, a beehive of esoteric activity and impenetrable jargon. In lesser hands, such a passage would leave non-specialist readers bewildered and bored. But then he describes himself in the simplest of scientific poses, looking into a microscope. And what he gazes at is one of the more sinister mysteries of human \u2013 or anti-human \u2013 life. The leukaemia cells he is examining came from a woman who has been dead for 30 years. Unlike their discarded host, these cells are \"immortal\".In this small but typical moment, Mukherjee manages to convey not only a forensically precise picture of what he sees, but a shiver, too, of what he feels. \"The cells look bloated and grotesque, with a dilated nucleus and a thin rim of cytoplasm, the sign of a cell whose very soul has been co-opted to divide and to keep dividing with pathological, monomaniacal purpose.\"The yoking of scientific expertise to narrative talent is rare enough, but the literary echoes of The Emperor of All Maladies suggest a desire to go further even than fine, accessible explanation. \"Normal cells are identically normal; malignant cells become unhappily malignant in unique ways.\"It takes some nerve to echo the first line of Anna Karenina and infer that the story of a disease is capable of bearing a Tolstoyan treatment. But that is, breathtakingly, what Mukherjee pulls off. He calls this great and beautiful book a biography, rather than a history, because he wants his reader to understand his subject not just as a disease, a scientific problem or a social condition, but as a character \u2013 an antagonist with a story to tell through its eerie relationships to the wider biological and animal world that is also, inexorably, our story.Though it has many historical antecedents, the epic medical quest to understand and treat cancer only really took shape as it emerged as a defining disease of modernity. This is the case not just in the metaphorical sense that it speaks potently to our industrialised terrors, but in the direct sense that cancer only became a leading cause of death in the world when we began to live long enough to get it.People in the past tended to die of other diseases \u2013 as they still do in poorer\u00a0countries today. Cancer now ranks just below heart disease as a cause of death in the US, but in low-income countries with shorter life expectancies, it doesn't even make the top 10. At the beginning of the 20th century, life expectancy at birth in America was 47.3 years. Now, the median age at diagnosis for breast cancer is 61; for prostate cancer, 67. As we extend our lives, Mukherjee writes, \"we inevitably unleash malignant growth\".Thus the scene is set for a monumental scientific, political and human struggle. Mukherjee assembles a teeming cast of characters: from ancients such as Atossa, the Persian queen who in 500BC self-prescribed the first recorded mastectomy, to Mukherjee's own patients. There are tales of grizzly surgical techniques and astonishing medical discoveries. But, as with any epic narrative, the central drama marches towards a war.The full-blown campaign against cancer began with the meeting in the 1940s of an American socialite, Mary Lasker, in search of a great medical cause, and the driven cancer researcher, Sidney Farber, one of the creators of chemotherapy. Mukherjee describes it as the coming together of two travellers, \"each carrying one half of a map\". The battlefield at the middle of the map was Washington DC and the political alliance that Lasker and Farber eventually formed was with Richard Nixon. The passing in 1971 of the National Cancer Act enshrined the idea of cancer as sovereign among diseases and bequeathed it the language of a world war.But as Mukherjee's narrative unearths his central character, and our understanding of cancer accumulates depth and complexity, the notion of a war becomes ever more threadbare. Its combatants had been configuring the enemy they needed to fight the war they wanted. Yet the story of science, Mukherjee observes, is not just one of discovery, but of the discovery of failure. The practitioners of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy had proceeded to treat cancer without understanding its fundamental mechanisms.Crusaders for a magic bullet, including Farber, were scornful of calls to wait on the development of genetic research, or to emphasise prevention, or to appreciate the need for care as much as \"cure\". To many who had worked on the front lines, relentlessly pushing patients to the brink of death to save them, such calls seemed academic. And then the academics called time out.In 1986, in The New England Journal of Medicine, John Bailar and Elaine Smith published a cold assessment of comparative trends in cancer mortality over the years. This revealed what they called a \"qualified failure\". Between 1962 and 1985, though duration of survival had improved in certain areas, the war on cancer had not only failed to show overall progress, but deaths from cancer had actually increased by 8.7%. Even accounting for the postwar boom in smoking-related lung cancer, Mukherjee writes, this \"shook the world of oncology by its roots\".It is from here, as he reaches for the final act in his historical drama, that it becomes clear that Mukherjee is doing more than providing an account of medical developments, scientific discovery and human suffering. The underlying structural dynamic of his book turns out to be the riddle of progress itself, the application of reason and science to chaos and disease \u2013 the uber-project of modernity that, even if it has achieved too much to be called a failure, can never finally succeed.As he turns inwards, to questions of the basic biology of the cancer cell, Mukherjee modifies his assessment of the war on cancer, from qualified failure to qualified success. There may have been no movement of the front lines of death, but if the aims could change, from utopian notions of eradicating death to more modest ambitions for the extension of life, then the result for medical science is a \"dynamic\" equilibrium rather than a \"static\" one.He returns to the cell itself, as genetic knowledge began to offer results that could be applied clinically \u2013 the search for causes finally coming together with the search for cures. By the end of the 1990s, the development of Gleevec as a genetics-based drug treatment for chronic myeloid leukaemia had, as one researcher put it, proved a principle: \"It demonstrates that highly specific, non-toxic therapy is possible.\"The cellular composition of cancer is Mukherjee's own field, but he is under no illusions that the new era will leave history behind, or that gene-based therapies will lead us out of the cancer age. Harold Varmus, accepting his Nobel prize for the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes in 1989, turned to Beowulf: \"We have only seen our monster more clearly and described his scales and fangs in new ways \u2013 ways that reveal a cancer cell to be, like Grendel, a distorted version of our normal selves.\"The idea that cancer cells are copies of who we are is, Mukherjee emphasises, not a metaphor. \"We can rid ourselves of cancer,\" he concludes, \"only as much as we can rid ourselves of the processes in our physiology that depend on growth \u2013 ageing, regeneration, healing, reproduction.\"And so his intensely vivid and precise descriptions of biological processes accumulate into a character, fully developed and eerily familiar. The notion of \"popular science\" doesn't come close to describing this achievement. It is literature.TopicsHealth, mind and body booksThe ObserverCancerScience and nature booksHealthSiddhartha MukherjeereviewsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Harry DodgeLucid and generous \u2026 Maggie Nelson. Photograph: Harry DodgeOlivia LaingFri 24 Apr 2015 01.00 AESTLast modified on Fri 23 Feb 2018 02.19 AEDTLet\u2019s start with an introduction. Maggie Nelson is one of the most electrifying writers at work in America today, among the sharpest and most supple thinkers of her generation. Born in 1973, she has so far produced nine books, four of poetry and five of non-fiction, knitting together what might in heavier hands be abstruse theory and humid confession to create an exhilarating new language for considering both the messiness of life and the meanings of art. If you haven\u2019t heard of her, it\u2019s because she is yet to be published in the UK, from which one might conclude that British publishing is becoming too timid for its own good.Her writing defies easy definition. Previous works include a philosophical survey of heartbreak and the colour blue (Bluets), two volumes about the abduction and murder of her aunt (Jane: A Murder and The Red Parts), and the magnificently invigorating The Art of Cruelty, a study of avant-garde art that turns by degrees into an unflinching investigation into the nature of violence itself. These books never quite settle into a fixed form. They float across categories, now memoir, now poetry, now philosophy, now criticism, too fleet and witty and subtle to be pinned down.The Argonauts is, likewise, resistant to summary, though describing it as a love story might come closest. It is, after all, about love and its fruits: both the falling in love and the maintaining of affection, devotion, tenderness. It is about love and marriage, motherhood, pregnancy, birth and family-making, and because it is a book by Maggie Nelson, it turns every one of these concepts on its head.The words \u201cI love you\u201d come in the very first paragraph, a confession uttered by Nelson to her debonair lover, the artist Harry Dodge. She falls for Dodge\u2019s brilliance, decency and immense sexual charisma, but during the early days of their courtship, she is not at all certain which pronoun her lover prefers to go by. Dodge is transgender, and not in accordance with the insistent media narrative of a man locked in a woman\u2019s body, but rather someone who does not wish to traffic in binaries at all (\u201cI\u2019m not on my way anywhere, Harry sometimes tells inquirers\u201d).They marry in a rush in the final hours before Prop 8 (the ruling that temporarily eliminated same-sex marriage in the state of California) passes, their sole witness a drag queen doing triple duty as the Hollywood chapel\u2019s greeter and bouncer. \u201cPoor marriage! Off we went to kill it (unforgivable). Or reinforce it (unforgivable).\u201d In the years that follow, they undergo dynamic shifts in their own bodies. Nelson undergoes gruelling rounds of IVF and then becomes pregnant; Dodge starts injecting testosterone and has top surgery, liberating him from years of painful chest-binding. His three-year-old son moves in with them part-time, and then their own baby, Iggy, joins the family.The Argonauts is about these small, miraculous domestic dramas, and the ardent acts of readjustment and care that they require, but it is also a reconsideration of what the institutions established around sexuality and reproduction mean if you come at them at a slant, if you disrupt them by the very fact of your being. Evictions and exclusions keep occurring. Friendly encounters with male waiters or service personnel are regularly unsettled when Dodge hands over his credit card with its female name, an act freighted with the threat of violence. During a Q&A, Nelson is asked by a well-known playwright how she managed to write a book about cruelty while pregnant. \u201cLeave it to the old patrician white guy to call the lady speaker back to her body, so that no one misses the spectacle of that wild oxymoron, the pregnant woman who thinks. Which is really just a pumped-up version of that more general oxymoron, a woman who thinks.\u201dThese narratives are interesting in and of themselves, but Nelson isn\u2019t just airing her feelings; she\u2019s bent on using these experiences as ways of prying the culture open, of investigating what it is that\u2019s being so avidly defended and policed. Binaries, mostly: the overwhelming need, to which the left is no more immune than the right, for categories to remain pure and unpolluted. Gay people marrying or becoming pregnant, individuals migrating from one gender to another, let alone refusing to commit to either, occasion immense turbulence in thought systems that depend on orderly separation and partition, which is part of the reason that the trans rights movement has proved so depressingly threatening to certain quarters of feminist thought.Real people are the objects of this boundary policing, and Nelson is at pains to make them visible, to show both the cost and virtue of their freedom. It is because she presents herself and Dodge so nakedly on the page that she is able to make light work of the thinkers, radical and conservative alike, who traffic in casually cruel abstracts and prohibitions. Of Baudrillard\u2019s claim that assisted reproduction heralds the suicide of the species by eliminating the mortal, sexed being, she observes tartly: \u201cHonestly, I find it more embarrassing than enraging to read Baudrillard, \u017di\u017eek, Badiou and other revered philosophers of the day pontificating on how we might save ourselves from the humanity-annihilating threat of the turkey-baster.\u201dThe kind of thinking Nelson does value is subtle, capable of ambiguity and arising out of close and careful observation, which is why it is not surprising that the British paediatrician and psychoanalyst DW Winnicott should emerge as something of a hero here. Winnicott is responsible for the concept of the good enough mother, and his refusal to insist on perfection makes him an ideal participant in Nelson\u2019s project of celebrating ordinary maternal devotion while castigating the canonisation of the mother that society uses to punish and shame women.In the largest sense, this is a book about dependence, about the way that life requires interpenetrations and boundary crossings of all kinds, beginning with the in utero experience of being housed within another\u2019s body, that \u201cmost mysterious and gory of apartments\u201d, and continuing through acts of extension that include both sex and reading, those journeys into the recesses of other minds and anatomies.Nelson is keen on both; positively evangelical on the subject of arse-fucking, but also lucid and generous when it comes to acknowledging the thinkers who have shaped and schooled her. Her list of \u201cthe many-gendered mothers of my heart\u201d ranges from the late and much missed Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, the fat, freckled queen of queer theory, to the porn star and performance artist Annie Sprinkle. What draws her are people who, as the critic Roland Barthes explains in his theory of the neutral, \u201cin the face of dogmatism, the menacing pressure to take sides, offers novel responses: to flee, to escape, to demur, to shift or refuse terms, to disengage, to turn away\u201d.This interest in dependence and ambiguity is reflected stylistically, too. The Nelsonian unit of thought is not the chapter but the paragraph, a mode that allows for deep swerves and juxtapositions, for the interspersing of anecdote and analysis. If the danger of being elliptical is that one sometimes sounds dotty, the reward is an ability to dodge enclosure, to achieve by way of judicious layering a complexity that is otherwise elusive. This is bolstered by Nelson\u2019s habit of lacing her text with italicised statements by other writers, the sources logged in the margins. The effect is musical, polyphonic, a conversation between multiple participants rather than a narcissistic aria.In the final pages, Nelson tells the story of Iggy\u2019s birth, mixing it with Dodge\u2019s own account of his mother\u2019s death. Birth is well-travelled ground in literature these days, but I have never read anything as luminous and exacting as these wrung accounts of the passage in and out of life. Earlier, Nelson describes the way a foetus creates space in the body where there was none, and it is precisely this extraordinary gift that her own writing possesses: a facility for making room, for offering up possibilities beyond the either/or, the this and that. Generative and generous, this is a book that belongs on the shelves of anyone who desires, especially if what they desire is nothing short of freedom itself.

Photograph: Alamy Stock PhotoAlex PrestonSun 9 Oct 2016 17.00 AEDTLast modified on Thu 22 Mar 2018 10.58 AEDTAs if we needed any more reason to mourn the passing of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, it\u2019s difficult to believe that either of his potential successors will share his fine taste in books. His 2016 summer holiday reading \u2013 released by the White House\u2019s press department \u2013 not only included Helen Macdonald\u2019s sublime H Is for Hawk, but also Colson Whitehead\u2019s The Underground Railroad. Bringing this brutal, vital, devastating novel to a wider audience (it has also been selected by Oprah\u2019s book club) will not be the least of Obama\u2019s legacies.The Underground Railroad begins on a particularly vicious Georgia plantation, where all anyone wants to do is escape. \u201cEvery slave thinks about it. In the morning and in the afternoon and in the night. Dreaming of it. Every dream a dream of escape even when it didn\u2019t look like it.\u201d We meet Ajarry, taken from her West African village and across the ocean on a slave ship. We meet her daughter, Mabel, who flees the plantation and its odious owner, Randall, prompting a wild and fruitless search, and Cora, Mabel\u2019s daughter, our heroine.Cora and Caesar are led down to a platform where rails stretch away into darkness. It\u2019s a brilliant conceitThis beginning of the novel strikes two clear chords. First, it draws on traditional slave testimonies by the likes of Solomon Northup and Harriet Jacobs. This is a book that wears its research lightly, but the subtly antique prose and detailed description\u00a0combine to create a world that is entirely convincing. In this opening section there are also nods to more recent influences: Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved and Lawrence Hill\u2019s The Book of Negroes, in particular.\u00a0A familiar visual and linguistic idiom has developed by which novelists and film-makers address the subject of slavery. The first 70 pages of The Underground Railroad are beautifully written and painful to read, but there is a sense of having been here before. Then everything changes.Cora, deciding to flee with Caesar, a fellow slave, finds herself swept into the great secret undertaking that is the underground railroad. And here is the spark that ignites the novel. For Whitehead has taken that historical metaphor \u2013 the network of abolitionists who helped ferry slaves out of the south \u2013 and made it into a glistening, steampunk reality. Cora and Caesar are led through a trapdoor and down to a subterranean platform where rails stretch away into darkness. A train pulls up, heading north. It\u2019s a brilliant conceit, and from this point forwards, the book takes on a visionary new life. Whitehead has always been one of those authors who move effortlessly between genres, as at home in the rigorously researched historical fiction of John Henry Days as he was in the futuristic zombie world of Zone One. Here, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s attempting to cram as many genres into one novel as possible, with science fiction meeting fantasy and a picaresque adventure tale, all against the backdrop of a reimagined 19th-century America.South Carolina, with skyscrapers redolent of Alan Moore\u2019s From Hell, is hiding dark secrets beneath a pristine exteriorThe narrative then doesn\u2019t draw breath as Cora is pursued by the malevolent slave catcher Ridgeway, whom we first meet attended by \u201ca fearsome Indian scout who wore a necklace of shrivelled ears\u201d. Ridgeway has as his life\u2019s mission the need to defend \u201cthe American spirit, the one that called us from the Old World to the New, to conquer and build and civilise. And destroy that what needs to be destroyed. To lift up the lesser races. If not lift up, subjugate. And if not\u00a0subjugate, exterminate. Our destiny\u00a0by divine prescription \u2013 the American imperative.\u201dCora rises from the underground railway into a world of bodysnatchers, night riders, sinister doctors, heroic station agents, conflicted abolitionists. She finds love, loses it, is happy for brief snatches of time before the remorseless Ridgeway catches up with her, and she must flee again. There\u2019s something Thomas Pynchon-like about the novel, but without Pynchon\u2019s desiccating distance, his endless tangents. Everything in Whitehead\u2019s narrative is\u00a0honed to scintillating sharpness.Another Day in the Death of America by Gary Younge \u2013 reviewRead moreAlongside the tumultuous intermingling of genres, there\u2019s a distinct allegorical flavour to Cora\u2019s journey. Each state she emerges into appears to present a new face of the horrors of slavery. South Carolina, with its skyscrapers redolent of Alan Moore\u2019s From Hell, and its seemingly benevolent approach to \u201cthe negro problem\u201d, is hiding dark secrets beneath its pristine exterior. North Carolina has decided to drive its black population out of the state altogether: \u201cIn North Carolina the negro race did not exist except at the ends of ropes.\u201d Roving mobs hang any blacks who remain along its freedom trail, where the \u201ccorpses went on for ever it seemed, in every direction\u201d. Here, Cora is made to live an Anne Frank existence in an attic \u2013 the parallel is clear enough that it must be intended. Then there\u2019s Tennessee, beset by biblical plagues, a hellish wasteland of burnt woods and quarantine towns overrun by yellow fever.It\u2019s at the end of the novel, though, that the allegorical mode is felt most strongly. It\u2019s to Whitehead\u2019s credit that he never strikes too hard on the parallels between America\u2019s current racial crisis and the material of his story\u00a0(although the reader can often think of nothing else). Instead, the author looks backwards, to a previous genocide \u2013 the massacre of Native Americans \u2013 and seeks to show that, as one character puts it, \u201cAmerica, too, is a delusion, the grandest one of all. The\u00a0white race believes \u2013 believes with all its heart \u2013 that it is their right to take the land. To kill Indians. Make war. Enslave their brothers. This nation\u00a0shouldn\u2019t exist, if there is any justice in the world, for its foundations\u00a0are murder, theft and cruelty.\u201d The book\u2019s final pages, which are almost unbearably poignant, seem to offer a model of resistance, a small gleam of hope.I haven\u2019t been as simultaneously moved and entertained by a book for many years. This is a luminous, furious, wildly inventive tale that not only shines a bright light on one of the darkest periods of history, but also opens up thrilling new vistas for the form of the novel itself.The Underground Railroad is published by Fleet (\u00a314.99).

I read it in bed, and couldn't sleep. I read it at my desk, and started to cry. Affairs are notoriously disruptive. You get parking tickets, cancel meetings, forget to feed the cat. Reading about an affair is not supposed to have the same effect. But it does in the case of Carol Ann Duffy's RaptureThere is a tradition for the sequence of love poems. It runs from Shakespeare's sonnets or John Donne's poems, through to Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Sonnets from the Portuguese and Adrienne Rich's Twenty-One Love Poems. For the most part, the tale is sad. Only EBB actually got to marry her man . . . and maybe that happy ending was a bit sad too.Towards the end of this collection, in \"The Love Poem\", Duffy acknowledges the debt. Weaving tags and quotations from well-known poems - \"my mistress' eyes\", \"let me count the ways\", \"dear heart\", \"O my America\" - she makes an epitaph for loss. She knows the end of the story, but she also knows what will survive. In the title poem she speaks of \"this chain of words\"; in \"Give\" the lover listens to \"the shadowy story I told\"; in \"Art\" love is left only in \"the chiselled, chilling marble of our kiss; / locked into soundless stone, our promises, / or fizzled into poems . . .\"Rapture is sad, but not bleak. It draws on tradition, but is very up to date. Duffy is a poet who surprises with images that are precisely funny. In \"Text\" the speaker, anxiously looking for secret messages from the beloved, is described tending \"the mobile now / like an injured bird\". The image returns in \"Wintering\" where Duffy says \"I clutch the small stiff body of my phone\". In \"Syntax\" - one of the most brilliant poems in the collection - she plays with the languages of past and present:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Because I so do -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 as we say now - I want to say\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thee, I adore, I adore thee . . .\"Some of Duffy's phrases will not let you be. Living our ordinary lives without passion, we are \"queuing for death\"; speaking ordinary phrases without telling the whole truth means that \"words, / are the cauls of the unsaid\". The grammar and the thematic structures of Duffy's poems can seem compacted, as in the opening line of \"Rapture\": \"Thought of by you all day, I think of you.\" But if you sometimes have to work hard to unknot Duffy's sense, the unravelling rewards.These poems are almost old-fashioned in their commitment to rhyme, assonance and metre. In several poems there is a fairytale vocabulary, and ballad forms appear in \"Betrothal\" and in \"Give\":\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Give me, you said, on our very first\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 night,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the forest. I rose from the bed and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 went out,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and when I returned, you listened,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 enthralled,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to the shadowy story I told.\"Duffy is a very brave poet. Only pop songs are braver in their use of repetition, and in \"Finding the Words\" she succeeds in making an ordinary \"I love you\" into something extraordinary. Only gameshow hosts are braver in their use of puns, and in \"Fall\" she rushes headlong through at least five meanings of the word, to end with another pun in \"your passionate gravity\".Born in 1955 in Glasgow, Duffy was brought up in Staffordshire. As a student in Liverpool she wrote poems and plays, became involved with \"the scene\" and Adrian Henry. With the collection Standing Female Nude (1985) she established her name. Three other important collections followed: Selling Manhattan (1987), The Other Country (1990) and Mean Time (1993), which won the Whitbread poetry award and the Forward prize. For someone who has made a comparatively quiet career, away from the public eye and the literary celebrity round, she has a loyal following and a high profile. When the appointment of a new poet laureate was last in the news, it was she who commanded the popular vote. She was made a CBE in 2001.To my mind, Duffy's most persuasive gifts are her unashamedly lyrical voice and her distinctively intellectual attention to repetition and wordplay. It is these talents that have made her much-anthologised poem \"Prayer\" - based on the names recited in the radio shipping forecast - so well-known. But it is her dramatic monologues, giving voice to the alienated and the dispossessed, that form the backbone of the two collections now much-read in schools, The World's Wife (1999) and Feminine Gospels (2002).Rapture is much riskier than any of Duffy's earlier works. It maintains an attention to detail even while shaping the larger arc of the story across 51 poems. Its tone ranges from the jokey \"Quickdraw\" - \"I wear the two, the mobile and the landline phones, / like guns, slung from the pockets on my hips\" - to one of the most scathingly private poems that I have ever read, \"Presents\":\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 snipped and stitched my soul\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to a little black dress,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 hung my heart on a necklace,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 tears for its pearls,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 my mouth went for a bracelet,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 gracing your arm,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 all my lover's words\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for its dangling charms,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and my mind was new hat,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sexy and chic,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for a hair of your head on my sleeve\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 like a scrawled receipt.The final poem in the collection takes lines from Robert Browning as its epigraph: \"That's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over, / Lest you should think he never could recapture / That first fine careless rapture!\" The quotation gives Duffy both the title of her collection and the title for this poem - \"Over\". The affair may be \"over\", but in her verse she can sing it \"over\" and the effect is uplifting and thrilling.Buy it. Keep it. Give it away.

Does the recent flurry of short books, including new offerings from Alan Bennett and Louis de Berni\u00e8res and potted biographies of Nabokov and Kafka, denote foreshortened ambition on the part of the writers or a sensitive regard for the limited attention spans and harassed schedules of their readership? When a fiction writer publishes a collection of stories, are we to feel cheated of a proper novel or appreciative of the parade of characters, plot lines and settings placed before us? Offcuts or experimentation? Fillers or gems? The answer is that you get a bit of both, although the distinction between bespoke collections and more apparently random gatherings, frequently made under the aegis of product-hungry publishers at various (often posthumous) points in a writer's career, is not a particularly reliable index to quality. But even the offcuts - where a short story might be seen as something like a doodle in the margin or a balled-up piece of paper - have something to tell us about the furtive preoccupations or abandoned hobbyhorses of their creators. It would be hard to accuse the Canadian writer Alice Munro of treating the short story as a glory hole of the imagination. In a lengthy and distinguished career, she has written only one novel, preferring to concentrate on what Lorna Sage, writing of another obsessive miniaturist, Katherine Mansfield, described as \"intensely crafted and evocative objects-on-the-page\". But Munro's stories spurn the idea of the short form as a fleeting glimpse of disposable characters' lives, a casually sophisticated backheel from the writer propelling them into a tidy ending. In her new collection, a narrator-writer who has been caught out making fiction from a relative's life defends herself by reflecting that her business is \"more like grabbing something out of air than constructing stories\". Munro deals in people whose fates have slowly worked themselves out over decades, and whose situations are richly complex and hedged about by history; if a writer must grab their stories out of air, then the resulting snapshots must be understood to be provisional. In the title story, taken from an adolescent counting game, we come as close as we will to a jeu d'esprit in the story of Johanna, a dowdy housekeeper of near invisibility who stakes her future on an uncharacteristic leap into the dark. Her teenage charge Sabitha, trembling with sexual awakening and uncomfortable spite, fabricates a letter from her widowed father revealing chaste love for Johanna, and pockets the latter's cautious replies. When Johanna purloins some squabbled-over furniture, marshals her savings and heads out into the unknown, we fear a horrible payoff of rejection and disillusionment, prefigured by the agonising moment when she recklessly buys herself a dress in which to be married. The moment of crisis never comes; Johanna and the widower rub along together in mutual dependency, and a son is born to them offstage. We will never know whether their union has been serendipitously happy or acrimoniously disappointing. It is left to Sabitha's accomplice to ponder the fruits of her deception: \"It was the whole twist of consequence that dismayed her - it seemed fantastical, but dull. Also insulting, like some sort of joke or inept warning, trying to get its hooks into her.\" Here, and throughout a collection peopled with escape artists and stay-at-homes, romancers and romanced, comes Munro's exceptional gift for undercutting her own conjuring tricks, as her characters, pinned to the mast of coincidence and invention, wriggle free and prove themselves ungovernable. \"It looked like adventures,\" as an elderly lady deep in recollection notes, \"but it was all according to script, if you know what I mean.\" There is a sense of script, too, in Muriel Spark's characteristically acerbic and humorously retributive stories, which span half a century of writing that, even in her novels, relies on a glancing sensibility and an elliptical archness. We are aware of a cool arranger behind the multitude of narrative voices, and a sardonic distance that immediately alerts the reader to the making of seductive patterns. Although these pieces follow no clear organising principle, there is a kind of convention in placing the most substantial at the head. \"The Go-Away Bird\", which first appeared in 1958, is a cautionary tale smattered with farce and very much in the Spark mould. Daphne, who has grown up in South Africa, longs plaintively for England until she actually goes there, and is mistreated by men and rapacious matrons alike; returning to what she must now call \"home\", she meets the violent and sinister end that seems, all along, to have been her destiny. One can only think of this as a blueprint. Indulging her taste for fantastical and occasionally demonic creatures, Spark also introduces us to a seraph, a dragon and various lunatic ghosts, including a hapless wraith who was once the visionary founder of the Society for the Abolition of Christmas, from which we gather that you mess around with rituals at your peril. Spark's determinedly light touch is enjoyable, but it serves mainly to direct us back to the novels. In Sylvia Townsend Warner's case, a collection of 20 short stories - many published in the New Yorker but none before appearing in book form - feels far more like the discovery of something unaccountably overlooked. Warner is squandered on equilibrium; the best approach to these diminutive masterpieces is to wait for a freak wind of depression or a bout of toothache and then hand yourself over to be enchanted. Her tableaux seem to break open the world, despite their long-disappeared settings and minor keys. Each is perfectly complete but highly suggestive, filled with quotidian trivia and then floated free on a gently rippling surface. Distant wars summarily subtract sons and husbands; scorching milk pans throw together disagreeable companions; random Christmas presents lurk beneath the surface of devoted marriages.\nAt the heart of the book are five stories set in an old-fashioned, connoisseurial antiques shop, in which Warner moves effortlessly between Wodehousian comedy and unbearably poignant reminiscence. \"English Mosaic\" sees Mr Edom, the shop's proprietor, convinced of an imminent attack on his china collection by a troublesome assistant; he sits guard all night with claret and grouse sandwiches, only for the utterly harmless Miss Hartley to disappear on the arm of a handsome customer. Her successor, far more Mr Edom's glass of claret, suddenly sheds the mantle of deference to narrate an extraordinary boyhood tale in \"The Candles\". From this antiques shop, a repository for discarded objects and a magnet for those searching for something lost, Warner could have magicked a novel, if not several. One could hardly find a greater contrast in writing or publishing styles than that between Warner and Arthur Bradford. Warner's book creeps on to the market with respectful, quasi-academic apparatus; Bradford's Dogwalker lurches brashly in, adorned with endorsements from Zadie Smith and Dave Eggers. Smith warns us that Bradford isn't as cute as the huge doggy face on his book jacket might suggest, but hey, we'd better \"get used to it\". Eggers tells us: \"If you don't like Arthur's stories, then you are not my friend.\" Resigned to being disowned and somehow judged not up to the task, we step anxiously into a parallel universe in which giant slugs are discovered in glove compartments, slacker types found dynasties of dog-children after a bit of hanky-panky with a pet, and a feline-featured flatmate turns out to be part of an entire family of circus freaks. The strange thing is, it takes no time at all to get used to this mildly diverting, passingly charming nonsense; after all, no story is strikingly different from another, and we are well used to doggy sex and gigantic insects these days. It doesn't exactly break open the world, but then again, not everything has to. It does, however, suggest that literary appreciation is fast becoming a matter of cultural grooves, in which if you don't care for antiques, you might dig dogs.TopicsBooksFictionMuriel SparkShort storiesSylvia Townsend WarnerreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

What is the upshot? Grand ambition about inequality \u2026 Thomas Piketty. Photograph: Charles Platiau/ReutersGrand ambition about inequality \u2026 Thomas Piketty. Photograph: Charles Platiau/ReutersStephanie FlandersThu 17 Jul 2014 16.30 AESTThis is a VIB \u2013 very important book. Nearly everyone agrees about that. But\u00a0the reasons for its importance have changed in the months since it was published. At first it was important because it was a big book on a big subject: a book of grand ambition about inequality, written not by the latest \"thinker\" but a respected academic economist with real numbers to go with\u00a0his theory. We hadn't had anything like that in ages. This was the \"Piketty as\u00a0rockstar\" phase, when the book was an \"improbable hit\" and people wrote breathless articles about the modern successor to Marx who could crunch the\u00a0numbers but also quote Balzac, The\u00a0Simpsons and The West Wing.Writing a bestselling economics book is usually a good way to make other economists hate you. But at first even they heaped praise on Thomas Piketty for casting fresh light on inequality \u2013 an\u00a0area where the official statistics are notoriously weak. Say what you like about the theory, the argument went, you had to thank him for the numbers.At this point you didn't need to read it to have an opinion about it. Indeed for some, not having read it was a badge of pride. Ed Miliband unashamedly told people he hadn't got beyond the first chapter \u2013 and kept on saying that for several weeks. Maybe he has now. Or maybe he's just decided that the debate about the book is more important than the book itself. That's certainly the conclusion I have come to, and not just because several of its central arguments have now been questioned.There are many claims in the 700-odd pages, but let me highlight some of the important ones, before moving on to whether \u2013 and why \u2013 any of this matters.Claim one is that income inequality has increased sharply since the late 1970s, with a particularly dramatic rise in the share of total income going to the very highest earners. The most quoted Piketty statistic here is one that no one, to my knowledge, has questioned: that 60% of the increase in US national income in the 30 years after 1977 went to\u00a0just the top 1% of earners. The only section of the US population that has done better than the top 1% is the top 10th of that 1%. The top 100th of the 1% have done best of all.These are remarkable numbers. Uncovering and bringing together this data for the US and a handful of other countries using tax returns is a major achievement, which\u00a0some say merits a Nobel prize on\u00a0its own. Piketty goes on to show that this dramatic rise in income inequality hasn't happened in all rich economies, and, oddly, does not really have much to do with capital. Even in the US, it has been driven by soaring salaries at the top end of the pay scale, not rising incomes from capital.That rather large complication to the story does not stop Piketty focusing the rest of the book on capital, which he says has also become more unequally distributed since the 1970s, not just in the US but in Europe too. He believes this trend toward greater wealth inequality is very likely to continue, because the returns from capital are likely to grow faster than the economy itself, and faster than the owners of that wealth are likely to be able to spend it.This is the \"central contradiction of capitalism\", which he summarises with a Marxian turn of phrase: \"the entrepreneur inevitably tends to become a rentier, more and more dominant over those who own nothing but their labour. Once constituted, capital reproduces itself faster than output increases. The past devours the future.\"This is where things get tricky, not just for Piketty but for the general reader, who simply wants to know whether he's right. Let me cut to the chase and say that the evidence for rising wealth inequality is not nearly as\u00a0clear as the evidence for rising inequality of incomes. Further, even some of Piketty's biggest fans in the academic world have their doubts whether the forces pushing the economy in that direction are as strong as he suggests. Most would agree that the developed economies are likely to\u00a0grow more slowly as their populations get older. This might have the \"terrifying\" consequences for wealth inequality that he suggests, but it's also possible that slower growth will be as costly to the owners of capital as it is for everyone else. Their share of the total pie might even decrease.That is actually what has happened in the UK recently. In the boom years after the mid 90s, the owners of capital took a larger share of national income, and the labour share tended to decline. But the trend reversed itself when the economy hit the skids in 2007, and the labour share is back to where it was in the early 70s. Income inequality has also fallen slightly over this period, at least in the UK. So, whatever terrible things have happened to our economy in the past five years, they haven't followed the long-term path sketched out by Piketty. Rather the opposite.There is some evidence that the top 10% in the US is sitting on a higher share of total wealth now than in the 70s. But it's difficult to draw similar conclusions about Britain or France because the data is so patchy. From what we can tell, the share of total wealth held by the top 1% \u2013 and 0.01% \u2013 hasn't changed much at all.Piketty has some interesting analysis demonstrating that wealth begets more wealth: the richer university endowments, for example, tend to earn the highest returns on their investments, not just in absolute but percentage terms. This rings true and also has some economic logic to it. The more money you have to invest, the more \u2013 in cash terms \u2013 you can afford to spend on finding the best opportunities, without materially cutting into your returns. As a force for rising wealth inequality this makes sense and probably merits a book of its own, given that individuals across the developed world are increasingly having to\u00a0take greater responsibility for saving for their retirement. It matters if small investors are going to be systematically disadvantaged in making these long-term investments.But the concentration of wealth at the top doesn't seem as inexorable as all that. As the economist and former US treasury secretary Larry Summers has pointed out, most of the people on the list of 400 wealthiest Americans in 1982 would have had enough to money to qualify in 2012 if they had simply earned a return of 4% a year. But fewer than a 10th actually did so. The proportion of the top 400 who inherited their wealth has actually been falling \u2013 not rising, as Piketty's theory would also suggest.Given what has been happening to incomes at the top, you would expect to have seen more concentration of wealth than we can find in the data. That might be \u2013 as Piketty suggests \u2013 because rich people are good at hiding their money from the taxman. But it might also be because they are very good at spending their money, and their children even more so. I was at a conference recently for advisers and trustees to family estates, and was amused to hear speaker\u00a0after speaker assert that the \"biggest threat\" to a family fortune was \"not the taxman or the markets but the family itself\".Say we agree with Piketty, and conclude that wealth has become more concentrated, his own numbers show this is a fairly recent phenomenon. As he\u00a0admits, the single most important structural change in the distribution of\u00a0wealth in the past 100 years has been\u00a0in the other direction. That is the emergence of a new \"patrimonial class\", somewhere between rich and poor, owning 25%-35% of the nation's wealth.He describes the emergence of this class in the middle years of the 20th century as a transformation that \"deeply altered the social landscape and the political structure of society and helped redefine the terms of distributive conflict\". That may well be true. But for me, what's more interesting about this shift is not what it might or might not have done for \"the terms of distributive conflict\", but what it did for households \u2013 and the broader economy. Piketty really doesn't go into that at all, which is a shame because if you don't have a clear understanding of the benefits of broader capital ownership it's difficult to explain why it's so \"terrifying\" if things are now moving back in the other direction.The latest official survey of UK household incomes and wealth shows that around a\u00a0third of all UK households has either negative net worth \u2013 debts greater than their assets \u2013 or net financial assets worth less than \u00a35,000. I\u00a0am more worried about that lack of wealth at the bottom and in the middle of the income scale than about the squillions being amassed by a very few.We know that families with that little to fall back on are much more likely to fall into long-term cycles of dependency and poverty. We also know \u2013 and if we\u00a0didn't know we could learn from reading the Daily Mail that Piketty's \"patrimonial middle class\" feels more squeezed these days, whatever might have happened to the financial value of\u00a0their home. He seems to assume that\u00a0all these things are connected, that the\u00a0greater income flowing to the 1% is making things worse for everyone else. But he never really makes the case. That is remarkable omission for a book of such magisterial sweep.When I was first learning economics in the late 80s and 90s, the UK was just getting used to the free-market idea that higher incomes at the top did not have to mean lower incomes at the bottom. To ensure growth in the economy, the message went, you had to give the \"wealth creators\" the incentive to increase both the pie and their slice of it.\u00a0Economists still believe that, up to a\u00a0point. But in the wake of the financial crisis there has been broader acceptance of the view that very high levels of income inequality can increase the risk\u00a0of such crises, and so hurt the economy. We also have evidence \u2013 from the IMF, of\u00a0all places \u2013 that in unequal economies, more redistributive taxes might promote faster growth. As with most things, it's a matter of degree.This all helps to explain why Piketty's book has been such a smash. Many people are worried about the slow rate of growth in the developed economies since the financial crisis in 2008. Many are also worried about rising inequality. At first glance, Capital seems to offer an elegant way to explain both. But, by his own admission, the world is a lot more complicated than talk of a \"central contradiction to capitalism\" might suggest. So is the relationship between capital accumulation and growth.Like Miliband, Piketty sees a clear difference between the wealth creators and the asset strippers \u2013 between the fat cat \"rentier\" capital that devours the future and the more socially useful capital of the entrepreneur. But his own broad definition of capital doesn't really help us draw that kind of distinction. It's all thrown in together, along with all of our houses, and everything else with a\u00a0financial value that can be bought or sold. That's a pity because if there's one\u00a0thing that policymakers around the\u00a0world are looking for it's a way to\u00a0channel a bit more money into productive investment \u2013 and a bit less into house prices and stocks and shares.Piketty deserves huge credit for kickstarting a debate about inequality and illuminating the distribution of income and wealth. But when it comes to the forces driving growth and wealth accumulation in our modern economy what he has probably done most to bring out into the open is our collective ignorance and confusion.

Photograph: Jason Clarke/The GuardianKate ClanchySat 1 Sep 2018 18.00 AESTLast modified on Thu 29 Nov 2018 03.48 AEDTOf all the praise lavished on Sally Rooney\u2019s first novel, Conversations with Friends \u2013 that it was glittering, witty, addictive, elegant, heartbreaking \u2013 only the insistence that it was especially contemporary, and \u201ccould sit with Lena Dunham\u2019s Girls\u201d, as the Sunday Times put it, didn\u2019t seem entirely applicable. True, the author was only 26; yes, the story took place in an Ireland where Catholicism no longer mattered, and everyone was a digital native; and the narrator, Frances, was a new graduate who started the book in a modishly fluid friendship/relationship with the avowedly lesbian and definitely woke Bobbi. But the instant messages were used to produce something like Platonic dialogues; email functioned, like Victorian letters, to consider the workings of the heart; time was marked by the publishing of novels and the passage of the seasons rather than the irruptions of news; and Frances was not only diagnosed with endometriosis without ever googling Lena Dunham but very soon abandoned her never specified relationship with Bobbi for an all-absorbing affair with an older married man, Nick.The resulting doomed romance appeared closer to Rosamond Lehmann\u2019s novel The Weather in the Streets (1936) or Barbara Trapido\u2019s Brother of the More Famous Jack (1982) than to chilly contemporary autofiction or\u00a0modish surrealism. There was the scant plot of these earlier classics, the romanticised, aphorising characters, the shamelessly beautiful sentences and exquisite, precisely considered suffering. There was even the calamitous female physicality, with Frances\u2019s bloody struggles with endometriosis reminiscent of Lehmann\u2019s portrayal of abortion or Trapido\u2019s of birth; and, underneath the relentless irony of the dialogue, Frances\u2019s haunting innocence and yearning, her distinctly pre-feminist sense of a lack of entitlement to love, which is perhaps much more like Lehmann\u2019s Invitation to the Waltz than Girls. Above, all there was an engaged, questing subjectivity and an underlying faith in fiction itself, which seemed modernist rather than contemporary. Frances\u2019s pain and striving are leading us somewhere: Frances is discovering her singular self and becoming a writer \u2013 and this, Rooney\u2019s passionate creation tells us, is worthwhile.Normal People, written in barely a year since that debut, is set mainly in the same shadowy, smoky, studenty Dublin, has the same witty dialogue and delicately observed play of often anxious feeling, and the same interludes of startlingly graphic, passionately intimate sex. It, too, is astonishingly fresh: in fact, when these books are shelved together in the future, it may seem that Normal People is the earlier work. It\u2019s a slightly smaller book, for a start. Conversations with Friends at least aspired to be a quadrille, including Bobbi and Nick\u2019s formidable wife Melissa in the dance, along with memorable turns from Frances\u2019s troubled parents. Normal People, by contrast, is a\u00a0waltz, or\u00a0possibly a tango, with two protagonists only:\u00a0Marianne, a skinny, anxious, clever girl, like Frances but with even less self-esteem and more masochistic tendencies, who begins the book as a\u00a0social outcast reading Swann\u2019s Way in the school lunch hall in Galway, and Connell, the apparently secure and popular working-class star of the football\u00a0team.Sally Rooney\u2019s first novel, Conversations with Friends, was a doomed romance. Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The GuardianThe spotlight is the brighter on these two because everyone else is just a little darker and more blurred than in Conversations with Friends. The couple\u2019s friends are not only more distant than Bobbi, but more cliched, absorbed in teenage intrigues about dances, committees and a slightly disconnected subplot with a death and funeral that recall Heathers or The Big Chill rather than life or books. The villains of the story are well drawn and thoroughly contemporary \u2013 the boyfriend with the sly taste for porn; the\u00a0sexist bully in a nightclub; an artist who exploits young women on\u00a0the internet \u2013 but they also each disappear within a\u00a0chapter or two, either without action from the protagonists, or even, in the case of the sinister artist, on request.Their families, too, have taken a step towards the vague and gothic. Connell\u2019s mother Lorraine comes, we are told, from a criminal family and had him at 17:\u00a0but this does not seem to have left her with any unsatisfied adult desires or even awkward acquaintances. Rather, she is consistently kind, selfless and wise, the \u201cgood mother\u201d counterpart to Marianne\u2019s widowed parent, who is\u00a0cold, neglectful and encourages her brother\u2019s violent bullying. But Denise is so vaguely drawn,\u00a0it seems even Marianne cannot be bothered to explain why. After an outrageous cruelty\u00a0on her\u00a0part, the\u00a0two\u00a0mothers and Marianne\u00a0directly encounter each other:They saw Marianne\u2019s mother in the supermarket. She was wearing a dark suit with a yellow silk blouse. She always looked so \u2018put together\u2019. Lorraine said hello politely and Denise just walked past, not speaking, eyes ahead. No one knew what she believed her grievance was. Even the differences of class and social ease between Connell and Marianne seem to dissolve as the book progresses. Connell goes to Trinity College Dublin alongside Marianne, who is now a social swan, and he\u00a0never thinks of football again.The energy and excitement of the story, then, must come from the couple themselves, their inner lives, what they see and imagine and read; from what Jane Austen called their \u201csensibilities\u201d. Fortunately, they have a lot of these, and Rooney evokes them superbly. Connell turns out to be quite a lot like Frances, too, and it is he, not Marianne, who is to be the writer. He may be defensive about this:It feels intellectually unserious to concern himself\u00a0with fictional people marrying each other. But there it is: literature moves him. One of his professors calls it the pleasure of being touched by\u00a0great art.And, whatever the reality or otherwise of the dangers\u00a0around them, however many times they\u00a0have absurd quarrels or, conversely, seem to meld and share an identity, that pleasure, of being touched\u00a0by great art, is to be had in reading the story\u00a0of Connell and Marianne, just because Rooney is such a\u00a0gifted, brave, adventurous writer, so exceptionally good at observing the lies people tell themselves on the deepest level, in noting how\u00a0much we forgive, and above all in portraying love. She shows the way it works on the skin \u2013 \u201cThe intensity of the privacy between them is\u00a0very severe, pressing in on him with an almost physical pressure on his face and body\u201d \u2013 and\u00a0the mind:He and Marianne are like figure-skaters, improvising their discussions so adeptly and in such perfect synchronisation that it surprises them both.Connell leaves the library \u201cin a state of strange emotional agitation\u201d when he has to break off from reading Jane Austen\u2019s Emma, and we feel the same way when he fails to explain properly to Marianne why he needs to spend the summer elsewhere, or when Marianne involves herself with a man she does\u00a0not even like. Connell does not look up the ending of\u00a0Emma on his phone, as surely most young people would, or even make a quip about the film Clueless, and we don\u2019t want him to, because his mind is more exciting than that.Normal People may not be\u00a0about being young right\u00a0now, but better than that, it shows\u00a0what it is to\u00a0be young and in love at any time.\u00a0It\u00a0may not be absolutely contemporary, but it is\u00a0a future classic.

Ageing, loss and compromise are explored in all their universal predictability and piercing individuality: we're all getting a visit from the goon squad.Appropriately enough, Jennifer Egan has set her novel in a milieu predicated both on nostalgia and the race for the next big thing: the music business. In punk-era San Francisco, teenagers in mohicans and safety pins take over from the greying hippies begging on street corners; by the 2020s, in a postwar baby boom, the quest for the youth market and the ubiquity of mobile technology reaches its logical conclusion, with all pop songs directed at toddlers (\"pointers\", so called for the ease with which they download songs on their handsets). The intervening years have seen the digitisation of music and the mainstreaming of rebellion, and now the youth of tomorrow eschew piercings and tattoos. \"And who could blame them, after watching three generations of flaccid tattoos droop like moth-eaten upholstery over poorly stuffed biceps and saggy asses?\"Egan's sprawling cast of loosely linked characters and episodic narrators are a vibrant collection of dropouts, survivors and misfits; they include record producer Bennie Salazar, Sasha, his kleptomaniac assistant, and various friends and family members. As we dip into their lives at critical points, not always in chronological order, the web of connection becomes ever more complex: Bennie's wife's brother assaults a movie star he's meant to be interviewing, who later works with a PR whose daughter ends up running a viral media campaign for Bennie . . . Mines laid early on in the narrative detonate after hundreds of pages: the book demands, and repays, a second reading.When we first meet Bennie he's already inured to his success, yearning nostalgically for the muddy authenticity of analogue recordings (digitisation is \"an aesthetic holocaust! Bennie knew better than to say this stuff aloud\") and sprinkling flakes of gold into his coffee in an attempt to get his mojo back, a habit more ostentatiously expensive than coke. But the \"deep thrill of the old songs\" lies, of course, in their power to return our youth to us: the Dead Kennedys are his aural equivalent of Proust's madeleine.The next section jumps back in time to the era of Bennie's teenage punk band, beautifully sketching their adolescent combination of posturing and sincerity, as well as developing currents of mismatched desire among a group of friends who've \"done everything together since fourth grade: hopscotch, jump rope, charm bracelets, buried treasure, Harriet the Spying, blood sisters, crank calls, pot, coke, Quaaludes\".That list conveys a keen, sweet flavour of time passing, as does the sad wonder with which these baby-faced punks regard their younger siblings, still playing in the lost kingdom of childhood. Throughout the novel, characters strain to apprehend time and its effects on the flux of personality \u2013 that desire, as Sasha puts it, to be able to say \"I'm changing I'm changing I'm changing: I've changed!\" Egan's chronologically jumbled structure is the perfect vehicle to express this, shuttling the reader between prophecy and hindsight. \"So this is it \u2013 what cost me all that time,\" says one narrator, reunited with the music mogul, now on his deathbed, who seduced her as a teenager and derailed her future plans. \"A man who turned out to be old, a house that turned out to be empty.\" What looked at 17 like the beginning of her life story became its dominant narrative.The desire to step outside time is symbolised in Sasha's autistic son's obsession with pauses in old songs \u2013 Bowie's \"Young Americans\", the Four Tops' \"Bernadette\", songs that are themselves pockets of frozen time. This section of the book, set in the future, is presented as a series of PowerPoint-style slides produced by a young girl for whom writing a diary in continuous narrative would be utterly old fashioned. Egan conjures a mood of poignant immediacy with these discrete, disconnected statements, as she does with the text messages that stud the final section.Such formal playfulness and variety is found throughout the book \u2013 a celebrity interview peppered with subversive footnotes; episodes narrated in the second person or first person plural, to conjure the disassociated mindset of a depressed college student or the camaraderie of the teenage band \u2013 but always used to increase its emotional power.This is an incredibly affecting novel, sad, funny and wise, which should make Jennifer Egan's name in the UK and is already picking up prizes. As well as being longlisted for the Orange prize, it recently won the US National Book Critics Circle fiction award, an event widely reported in terms of the surprising news that Jonathan Franzen's Freedom hadn't won.In fact, the two books have a lot in common: poignantly comic social novels told from multiple viewpoints which set up a nice tension between authorial omniscience \u2013 Egan often steps back to make casual reference to future events \u2013 and the doubts and confusion of their cast. Egan even includes the Franzenesque trope of sending a restless character on an unlikely money-making foray abroad, flexing free-market muscles in an exotic environment where corruption and danger are rather sharper threats than in middle-class America.While Franzen's last two novels ventured to Lithuania and Paraguay, Egan dispatches a down-on-her-luck publicist to Africa on a mission to improve the global standing of a genocidal dictator by linking him romantically to an American celebrity. (Imagine Charles Taylor doing a Hello! spread with Britney Spears.) It works as a highly coloured satire on PR (\"Dolly had worked with shitheads before, God knew\") but, like Franzen's similarly OTT interludes, jars with the rest of the book, in which daily life is colourful enough already. A Visit from the Goon Squad is a novel to relish, and Egan is a writer in her prime.TopicsFictionJennifer EganreviewsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Tom Carter/AlamyOne of Saunders\u2019s stories takes place in a medieval-themed amusement park. Photograph: Tom Carter/AlamyDavid WolfSun 6 Jan 2013 11.05 AEDTGeorge Saunders \u2013 Texas-born, Chicago-raised, seven books, many prizes, satirist, Buddhist \u2013 is one of America's best short-story writers. But reading his new collection, Tenth of December, it seems like he's stuck. Saunders emerged fully formed with his 1996 debut, Civilwarland in Bad Decline. That book was met with whoops of joy: \"scary, hilarious and unforgettable\" announced Tobias Wolff; \"wildly funny, pure, generous\" applauded Garrison Keillor; \"graceful, dark, authentic, and funny\" cheered Thomas Pynchon (Thomas Pynchon!). A pre-Infinite Jest David Foster Wallace declared in an interview: \"The person I'm highest on right now is George Saunders.\"Since then, Saunders has remained faithful to the short-story form, painstakingly crafting new pieces, which land in the New Yorker or some other classy US magazine once every three or four months. His new collection is his first in six years. For those familiar with Saunders, it is undoubtedly more of a good thing. Trouble is, it's also more of the same.Tenth of December presents 10\u00a0visions of America mostly filtered through the eyes of losers with one-syllable names such as Al and Kyle and Jeff. The stories tend to take place in self-contained suburban or small-town settings. No one here is successful or cool. Sometimes they are uncool in a virtuous way. Sometimes they are uncool and mean. The narrator of one story (his name is Ted) has the hesitant, disappointed voice of a typical Saunders protagonist: \"Based on my experience of life, which I have not exactly hit out of the park, I tend to agree with that thing about, If it's not broke, don't fix it.\"As usual with Saunders, the first thing you notice is the language, the exhilarating explosion of slang, neologisms, fake product names. The reader is wired into the protagonists' heads, the stories told either in the first person or in a third person that moulds itself around the characters' thoughts, taking on their voices. The first story, \"Victory Lap\", toggles between the perspective of Alison, a 14-year-old girl with delusions of grandeur (\"The local boys possessed a certain je ne sais quoi, which, tell the truth, she was not tr\u00e8s crazy about\"); Kyle, a teenage dork in love with Alison (\"In the dictionary under 'beauty' there should be a picture of her in that jean skirt\"); and an unnamed murderer/rapist who attempts to abduct Alison (\"If fuckwise it went good they'd pick up the freeway from there. Basically steal the van\"). Few writers are so good at transcribing thought \u2013 Saunders never jams his own observations into his characters' mouths and he is especially skilful at mimicking the way fantasies and daydreams colour the way we think.The distance between the characters' hopes and the reality of their situations is one of the themes Saunders returns to throughout Tenth of December. In \"Al Roosten\", for instance, the title character, a \"round bald guy\", boils with jealousy and self-loathing as he considers a richer, happier, better-looking acquaintance. Al is a masterful study of impotent rage, Dostoevsky's Underground Man transported to small-town America and stuffed into a gondolier outfit for a charity fundraising event.Yet for all the successful stories, some of Tenth of December feels like it could have been lifted straight out of Saunders's previous collections. Set in a medieval-themed amusement park, \"My Chivalric Fiasco\" is a little too close to the caveman- and civil war-themed amusement parks seen in his earlier work. The fake product names in \"Escape from Spiderhead\" (MobiPak\u2122, ViviStif\u2122, Darkenfloxx\u2122) recall his other product names (I Can Speak\u2122, Aurabon\u00ae etc). And for a writer with such a great ear, it's a pity Saunders so often returns to characters with the same voice \u2013 the naive, slightly childish, slightly too literal guy who says things such as, \"I knew Don Murray was her boss because Don Murray was also my boss\" or \"I could not help but wonder what tomorrow would bring\".If this collection does edge in a new direction, it is in Saunders's slight shuffle towards realism, away from the more wildly imaginative stories that dominated his earlier books (there is no sword-wielding packet of Doritos in this collection, for instance). One standout example is \"Home\", the story of a soldier's return from an unnamed war in the Middle East. Plot-wise there's nothing new here \u2013 Mike is suffering from something like post-traumatic stress disorder, the home he returns to is not the one he remembers, he feels alienated from everyone he meets. Yet the story unfolds in such an understated, unsentimental and funny way that by the end, it is impossibly moving. \"Thank you for your service\", becomes a bleak punchline, as everyone robotically delivers the same refrain to Mike.Saunders has always balanced his satirical urges with genuine warmth and affection for his characters. And while critics often compare him to Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut and the master of deadpan absurdism, Donald Barthelme, an equally apt touchstone might be The Simpsons. Like Matt Groening's creation, the stories in Tenth of December mix crude and sophisticated satire of American life with an essentially warm-hearted, optimistic worldview. \"Goodness is not only possible, it is our natural state,\" says Saunders in the book's acknowledgements. When his characters do bad things, it is usually because they are corrupted \u2013 by parents, by advertising, by pressure to get ahead, to be successful. Most of the time, though, they are just ordinary people doing the best they can.David Wolf is books editor of ProspectTopicsShort storiesThe ObserverThomas PynchonDavid Foster WallaceKurt VonnegutMark TwainDonald BarthelmeArt and design booksreviewsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: AlamyThe biotech\u00adnological revolution signals our replacement by post-humans. Photograph: AlamyGalen StrawsonThu 11 Sep 2014 16.30 AESTHuman beings (members of the genus Homo) have existed for about 2.4m years. Homo sapiens, our own wildly egregious species of great apes, has only existed for 6% of that time \u2013 about 150,000 years. So a book whose main title is Sapiens shouldn't be subtitled \"A Brief History of Humankind\". It's easy to see why Yuval Noah Harari devotes 95% of his book to us as a species: self-ignorant as we are, we still know far more about ourselves than about other species of human beings, including several that have become extinct since we first walked the Earth. The fact remains that the history of sapiens \u2013 Harari's name for us \u2013 is only a very small part of the history of humankind.Can its full sweep be conveyed in one fell swoop \u2013 400 pages? Not really; it's easier to write a brief history of time \u2013 all 14bn years \u2013 and Harari also spends many pages on our present and possible future rather than our past. But the deep lines of the story of sapiens are fairly uncontentious, and he sets them out with verve.For the first half of our existence we potter along unremarkably; then we undergo a series of revolutions. First, the \"cognitive\" revolution: about 70,000 years ago, we start to behave in far more ingenious ways than before, for reasons that are still obscure, and we spread rapidly across the planet. About 11,000 years ago we enter on the agricultural revolution, converting in increasing numbers from foraging (hunting and gathering) to farming. The \"scientific revolution\" begins about 500 years ago. It triggers the industrial revolution, about 250 years ago, which triggers in turn the information revolution, about 50 years ago, which triggers the biotechnological revolution, which is still wet behind the ears. Harari suspects that the biotechnological revolution signals the end of sapiens: we will be replaced by bioengineered post-humans, \"amortal\" cyborgs, capable of\u00a0living forever.This is one way to lay things out. Harari embeds many other momentous events, most notably the development of language: we become able to think sharply about abstract matters, cooperate in ever larger numbers, and, perhaps most crucially, gossip. There is the rise of religion and the slow overpowering of polytheisms by more or less toxic monotheisms. Then there is the evolution of money and, more importantly, credit. There is, connectedly, the spread of empires and trade as well as the rise of capitalism.Harari swashbuckles through these vast and intricate matters in a way that is \u2013 at its best \u2013 engaging and informative. It's a neat thought that \"we did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us.\" There was, Harari says, \"a Faustian bargain between humans and grains\" in which our species \"cast off its intimate symbiosis with nature and sprinted towards greed and alienation\". It was a bad bargain: \"the agricultural revolution was history's biggest fraud\". More often than not it brought a worse diet, longer hours of work, greater risk of starvation, crowded living conditions, greatly increased susceptibility to disease, new forms of insecurity and uglier forms of hierarchy. Harari thinks we may have been better off in the stone age, and he has powerful things to say about the wickedness of factory farming, concluding with one of his many superlatives: \"modern industrial agriculture might well be the greatest crime in history\".He accepts the common view that the fundamental structure of our emotions and desires hasn't been touched by any of these revolutions: \"our eating habits, our conflicts and our sexuality are all a result of the way our hunter-gatherer minds interact with our current post-industrial environment, with its mega-cities, airplanes, telephones and computers \u2026 Today we may be living in high-rise apartments with over-stuffed refrigerators, but our DNA still thinks we are in the savannah.\" He gives a familiar illustration \u2013 our powerful desires for sugar and fat have led to the widespread availability of foods that are primary causes of unhealthiness and ugliness. The consumption of pornography is another good example. It's just like overeating: if the minds of pornography addicts could be seen as bodies, they would look just like the grossly obese.At one point Harari claims that \"the leading project of the scientific revolution\" is the Gilgamesh Project (named after the hero of the epic who set out to\u00a0destroy death): \"to give humankind eternal life\" or \"amortality\". He is sanguine about its eventual success. But amortality isn't immortality, because it will always be possible for us to die by violence, and Harari is plausibly sceptical about how much good it will do us. As amortals, we may become hysterically and disablingly cautious (Larry Niven develops the point nicely in his description of the \"Puppeteers\" in the Ringworld science fiction novels). The deaths of those we love may become far more terrible. We may grow weary of all things under the sun \u2013 even in heaven (see the last chapter of Julian Barnes's A\u00a0History of the World in 10\u00bd Chapters). We may come to agree with JRR Tolkien's elves, who saw mortality as\u00a0a\u00a0gift to human beings that they themselves lacked. We may come to feel what Philip Larkin felt: \"Beneath it\u00a0all, desire\u00a0of oblivion runs.\"Even if we put all these points aside, there's no guarantee that amortality will bring greater happiness. Harari draws on well-known research that shows that a person's happiness from day to day has remarkably little to do with their material circumstances. Certainly money can make a difference \u2013 but only when it lifts us out of poverty. After that, more money changes little or nothing. Certainly a lottery winner is lifted by her luck, but after about 18 months her average everyday happiness reverts to\u00a0its old level. If we had an infallible \"happyometer\", and toured Orange County and the streets of Kolkata, it's not clear that we would get consistently higher readings in the first place than in the second.This point about happiness is a persistent theme in Sapiens. When Arthur Brooks (head of the conservative American Enterprise Institute) made a related point in the New York Times in July, he was criticised for trying to favour the rich and justify income inequality. The criticism was confused, for although current inequalities of income are repellent, and harmful to all, the happiness research is well confirmed. This doesn't, however, prevent Harari from suggesting that the lives lived by sapiens today may be worse overall than the lives they lived 15,000 years ago.Much of Sapiens is extremely interesting, and it is often well expressed. As one reads on, however, the attractive features of the book are overwhelmed by carelessness, exaggeration and sensationalism. Never mind his standard and repeated misuse of the saying \"the exception proves the rule\" (it means that exceptional or rare cases test and confirm the rule, because the rule turns out to apply even in those cases). There's a kind of vandalism in\u00a0Harari's sweeping judgments, his recklessness about causal connections, his hyper-Procrustean stretchings and loppings of the data. Take his account of the battle of Navarino. Starting from the fact that British investors stood to lose money if the Greeks lost their war of independence, Harari moves fast: \"the bond holders' interest was the national interest, so the British organised an international fleet that, in 1827, sank the main Ottoman flotilla in the battle of Navarino. After centuries of subjugation, Greece was finally free.\" This is wildly distorted \u2013 and Greece was not then free. To see how bad it is, it's enough to look at the wikipedia entry on Navarino.Harari hates \"modern liberal culture\", but his attack is a caricature and it boomerangs back at him. Liberal humanism, he says, \"is a religion\". It \"does not deny the existence of God\"; \"all humanists worship humanity\"; \"a huge gulf is opening between the tenets of liberal humanism and the latest findings of the life sciences\". This is silly. It's also sad to see the great Adam Smith drafted in once again as the apostle of greed. Still, Harari is probably right that \"only a criminal buys a\u00a0house \u2026 by handing over a suitcase of\u00a0banknotes\" \u2013 a point that acquires piquancy when one considers that about 35% of all purchases at the high end of the London housing market are currently being paid in cash.

Illustration: Clifford Harper/Agraphia.co.ukAlex ClarkWed 6 Mar 2013 21.54 AEDTKate Atkinson's new novel is a marvel, a great big confidence trick \u2013 but one that invites the reader to take part in the deception. In fact, it is impossible to ignore it. Every time you attempt to\u00a0lose yourself in the story of Ursula Todd, a child born in affluent and comparatively happy circumstances on\u00a011 February 1910, it simply stops. If\u00a0this sounds like the quick route to a\u00a0short book, don't worry: the narrative starts again \u2013 and again and again \u2013 but each time it takes a different course, its\u00a0details sometimes radically, sometimes marginally altered, its outcome utterly unpredictable. Atkinson's general rule is that things seem to get better with repetition, but\u00a0this, her self-undermining novel seems\u00a0to warn us,\u00a0is a comfort that is\u00a0by no means guaranteed, either.She begins as she means to go on, and at the very beginning. (In fact, even this is not quite true: a brief prologue shows us Ursula in a Munich coffee shop in 1930, assassinating Hitler with her father's old service revolver.) At the start of the novel \"proper\", Sylvie Todd is giving birth\u00a0to\u00a0her third child, her situation given\u00a0a\u00a0fairytale atmosphere by the encroaching snow which also, alas, cuts her off from outside help in the form of Dr Fellowes or Mrs Haddock, the midwife. Ursula is stillborn, with the umbilical cord wrapped around her\u00a0neck, her life unsaved for want of a\u00a0pair\u00a0of surgical scissors. Fortunately, though, she is allowed another go at the business of coming into being; in take two, Dr Fellowes makes it, cuts the cord and proceeds to his reward of a cold collation and some homemade piccalilli (it might be too fanciful to notice that even the piccalilli repeats).Ursula's childhood is to be punctuated with such near-misses: the treacherous undertow of the Cornish sea, icy tiles during a rooftop escapade, the wildfire spread of Spanish flu. Each disaster is confirmed by variations on the phrase \"darkness fell\", and each new beginning heralded by the tabula rasa that snow brings. Ursula carries within her a vague, dimly apprehended sense of other, semi-lived lives, inexpressible except as impetuous actions \u2013 such as when she pushes a housemaid down the stairs to save her\u00a0from a more terrible ending. That misdemeanour lands her in the office of a psychiatrist who introduces her, in\u00a0kindly fashion, to the concept of reincarnation and to the roughly opposing theory of amor fati, particularly as espoused by Nietzsche: the acceptance, or even embrace, of one's fate, and the rejection of the idea that anything could, or should, have unfolded differently.Amor fati is tough to take, of course,\u00a0if you are a drowning child, or\u00a0a\u00a0battered wife, or a shell-shocked young man, or a terrified mother calling for your baby in the rubble of the blitz, all of whom and more besides make up the lives captured, however fleetingly, in Life After Life. It's equally tough if you are a novelist, and put in\u00a0the powerful but invidious position of controlling what befalls your characters. Are their futures really written in their past? Can you tell what's going to happen to them simply from the way you started them off? Even sustaining your creative engagement could prove tricky: perhaps that's why one catastrophe is\u00a0tagged with the exhausted words \"Darkness, and so on\" and why yet another recitation of Ursula's birth is\u00a0reduced to a mere five lines.The reader is similarly implicated in\u00a0this continual manipulation of narrative tension and the suspension of disbelief. We want a story, but what kind of story do we want: something truthful or something soothing, something that ties up loose ends or something that casts us on to a\u00a0tide of uncertainty, not only about what might happen, but about what already has? In Atkinson's model, we can have all of the above, but where does that leave us, with multiple tall tales clamouring for our attention?Sometimes, it appears we are being offered a straight choice between happy and unhappy endings. On the one hand, there is Fox Corner, the Todd family home in what is still, although perhaps not for long, a wonderfully bucolic England. There are gin slings and tennis on the lawn and bees buzzing their \"summer afternoon lullaby\"; there is the reliable accumulation of children \u2013 Ursula is the third of five \u2013 and servants that are\u00a0either touchingly steadfast or humorously difficult; there are beloved family dogs and treasured dolls and troublesome aunts whose bad behaviour can just about be absorbed.Outside in the lane, however, lurks an evil-minded stranger, his story the more powerful for never being brought into the light; and sometimes intruders arrive under the cloak of friendship. When Ursula is molested, and then raped, by a pal of one of her brothers, her exile from Fox Corner begins; her subsequent pregnancy and illegal abortion give way to a lonely London life, solitary drinking and then, most awfully, to a violent husband who shuts her up in a mean little house in Wealdstone, far from her family.Ursula's marriage to the vile Derek Oliphant \u2013 himself a constructor of false personal history \u2013 would never have happened if she had managed to evade her teenage abuser. In the next iteration, she does; and she is liberated once more, to plunge on to lives made perhaps even more divergent by the schism of the second world war. And the reader is perplexed once more: what to make of a character so chameleon-like that we can watch her excavating bomb sites on one page, stranded in a dystopian, war-torn Berlin on another and (in what admittedly requires the biggest leap of faith) being entertained by the F\u00fchrer at Berchtesgaden on yet\u00a0another?This description of Atkinson's looping, metamorphosing narrative inevitably makes it sound tricksy, almost whimsical. Structurally, it is, but its ceaseless renewals are populated with pleasures that extend beyond the what-next variety. She captures well, for example, the\u00a0traumatic shifts in British society \u2013 and\u00a0does so precisely because she cuts\u00a0directly from one war to the next, only later going back to fill in, partially, what\u00a0happened in between. She demonstrates an extraordinary gift\u00a0for\u00a0capturing peril: the sections in\u00a0which influenza tears through Fox Corner are truly menacing, and the descriptions of\u00a0Ursula's work in a bombed-out London are masterpieces of the macabre (\"'Be careful here, Mr Emslie,' she said over her shoulder, 'there's a baby, try to avoid it.'\").The texture of daily life is beautifully conveyed, particularly in its\u00a0domestic details, which often verge on the queasily visceral. An ineptly poached egg is \"a sickly jellyfish deposited on toast to die\"; shortly after Sylvie's confinement, Mrs Glover, the crosspatch cook, \"took a bowl of kidneys soaking in milk from the pantry and commenced removing the\u00a0fatty white membrane, like a caul\". On\u00a0another occasion, she thumps slices\u00a0of\u00a0veal with a tenderiser, imagining \"they're the heads of the Boche\". But alongside these minutiae is set the author's fascination with the intricacies of large families, and in particular with sibling relationships.The so-called family saga is, of course, where Atkinson's career as a novelist began, with the Whitbread-winning Behind the Scenes at the Museum, itself a story that refused to\u00a0proceed in linear fashion, invoking the\u00a0spirit of Tristram Shandy in its digressive portrayal of the life of Ruby\u00a0Lennox. Neither book, of course,\u00a0can\u00a0really be contained by such\u00a0a constricting label, just as Atkinson's four Jackson Brodie novels\u00a0refuse to fit\u00a0neatly into the genre marked crime. Behind the Scenes\u00a0and Life After Life\u00a0both co-opt the family \u2013 its evolution over time, its exponentially multiplying characters and storylines, its silences and gaps in\u00a0communication \u2013 and use it to show\u00a0how fiction works and what it might mean to us. But what makes Atkinson an exceptional writer \u2013 and this is her most ambitious and most gripping work to date \u2013 is that she does\u00a0so with\u00a0an emotional delicacy and\u00a0understanding that transcend experiment or playfulness. Life After Life gives us a heroine whose fictional underpinning is permanently exposed, whose artificial status is never in doubt; and yet one who feels painfully, horribly real to us. How do you square that circle? You'd have to ask Kate Atkinson, but I doubt she would give\u00a0you a\u00a0straight answer.TopicsFictionKate AtkinsonreviewsReuse this contentcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backcomments (\u2026)Commenting has been disabled at this time but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion when it's backFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Lenin believed that it was in conditions of catastrophic upheaval that humanity advances most rapidly, and the idea that economic progress can be achieved through the devastation of entire societies has been a key part of the neo-liberal cult of the free market. Soviet-style economies left an inheritance of human and ecological devastation, while neo-liberal policies have had results that are not radically dissimilar in many countries. Yet, while the Marxist faith in central planning is now confined to a few dingy sects, a quasi-religious belief in free markets continues to shape the policies of governments.Many writers have pointed to the havoc and ruin that have accompanied the imposition of free markets across the world. Whether in Africa, Asia, Latin America or post-communist Europe, policies of wholesale privatisation and structural adjustment have led to declining economic activity and social dislocation on a massive scale. Anyone who has watched a country lurch from one crisis to another as the bureaucrats of the IMF impose cut after cut in pursuit of the holy grail of stabilisation will recognise the process Naomi Klein describes in her latest and most important book to date. Visiting Argentina not long before the economic collapse of 2002, I found the government struggling to implement an IMF diktat to roll back public spending at a time when the economy was already rapidly contracting. The result was predictable, and the country was plunged into a depression, with calamitous consequences in terms of poverty and social breakdown.Klein believes that neo-liberalism belongs among \"the closed, fundamentalist doctrines that cannot co-exist with other belief-systems ... The world as it is must be erased to make way for their purist invention. Rooted in biblical fantasies of great floods and great fires, it is a logic that leads ineluctably towards violence.\" As Klein sees it, the social breakdowns that have accompanied neo-liberal economic policies are not the result of incompetence or mismanagement. They are integral to the free-market project, which can only advance against a background of disasters. At times, writing in a populist vein that echoes her first book No Logo, published seven years ago, Klein seems to suggest that these disasters are manufactured as part of a deliberate policy framed by corporations with hidden influence in government. Her more considered view, which is also more plausible, is that disaster is part of the normal functioning of the type of capitalism we have today: \"An economic system that requires constant growth, while bucking almost all serious attempts at environmental regulation, generates a steady stream of disasters all on its own, whether military, ecological or financial. The appetite for easy, short-term profits offered by purely speculative investment has turned the stock, currency and real estate markets into crisis-creation machines, as the Asian financial crisis, the Mexican peso crisis and the dotcom collapse all demonstrate.\"There are very few books that really help us understand the present. The Shock Doctrine is one of those books. Ranging across the world, Klein exposes the strikingly similar policies that enabled the imposition of free markets in countries as different as Pinochet's Chile, Yeltsin's Russia, China and post-Saddam Iraq. Part of the power of this book comes from the parallels she observes in seemingly unrelated developments. In a fascinating and alarming examination of the underside of recent history, she notes the affinities between the policies of shock therapy imposed in the course of neo-liberal market reform and the techniques of torture that have been routinely used by the US in the course of the \"war on terror\". Klein begins her first chapter with a moving account of a conversation she had with a victim of a covert programme of mind-control experiments, carried out in Canada in the 1950s, which used people suffering from minor psychiatric ailments to try out techniques of \"de-patterning\" that aimed to scramble and reshape their personalities.Employing electroshock therapy, sensory deprivation and drug-induced comas, these experiments helped develop some of the \"coercive interrogation techniques\" that have been practised in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Klein uses torture as a metaphor, and does not claim any cause-and-effect link between its re-emergence and the rise of neo-liberal shock therapy; but she does point to some disquieting similarities. Individuals and societies have been \"de-patterned\" with the aim of remaking them on a better, more rational model. In each case, the experiments have failed, while inflicting lasting and often irreparable damage on those who were subjected to them.But has the free market experiment failed? As Klein sees it, free market shock therapy may actually have succeeded in achieving its true objectives. Post-invasion Iraq may be \"a ghoulish dystopia where going to a simple business meeting could get you lynched, burned alive or beheaded\". Even so, Klein points out, Halliburton is making handsome profits - it has built the green zone as a corporate city-state, and taken on many of the traditional functions of the armed forces in Iraq. An entire society has been destroyed, but the corporations that operate in the ruins are doing rather well. Klein's message, then, seems to be that - at least in its own, profit-centred terms - disaster capitalism works.There can be no doubt that fortunes have been reaped from the Iraq war as they have been from other experiments in disaster capitalism. Yet I remain unconvinced that the corporations Klein berates throughout the book understand, let alone control, the anarchic global capitalism that has been allowed to develop over the past couple of decades - any more than the neo-liberal ideologues who helped create it foresaw where it would lead. Rightly, Klein insists that free market ideology must bear responsibility for the crimes committed on its behalf - just as Marxist ideology must be held to account for the crimes of communism. But she says remarkably little about the illusions by which neo-liberal ideologues were themselves blinded. Milton Friedman and his disciples believed a western-style free market would spring up spontaneously in post-communist Russia. They were left gawping when central planning was followed by the criminalised free-for-all of the 90s, and were unprepared for the rise of Putin's resource-based state capitalism. These ideologues were not the sinister, Dr Strangelove-like figures of the anti-capitalist imagination. They were comically deluded bien-pensants, who promoted their utopian schemes with messianic fervour and have been left stranded by history, as the radiant future they confidently predicted has failed to arrive.The neo-liberal order is already facing intractable problems. The Iraq war may have allowed another experiment in shock therapy, but a failed state has been created as a result of which Gulf oil - which a former chair of the US joint chiefs of staff accurately described as \"the jugular vein of global capitalism\" - is less secure than before. Faced with defeat in Iraq, the Bush administration seems to be gearing up for an assault on Iran - a desperate move that would magnify the existing catastrophe many times over. At the same time financial crisis has reached into the American heartland as an implosion in speculation-driven credit markets has started to spread throughout the system. It is impossible to know how these crises will develop, but it is hard to resist the suspicion that disaster capitalism is now creating disasters larger than it can handle.\u00b7 John Gray's most recent book is Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and The Death of Utopia (Allen Lane)TopicsBooksPolitics booksNaomi KleinreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The one thing that kept me going through that dark, soul-numbing winter was Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White. I gobbled it on the bus, under the counter and in too-hasty snatches in the fluorescent staff canteen. As Gothic intrigue, madness and terror loomed, Charnos and Elbeo receded. It saved me, as extraordinary books can and do. Now Debenhams is a dim and dreary memory, but this past week Sarah Waters has thrilled me in identical ways to Collins with this, her third novel. Addicted to its atmosphere and hung up on its plot, I've gulped it exhaustedly until 3am, only to sleep and dream that I was still caught among its urgent, unnerving characters. In the 1860s, the Borough - the shanty town at the wrong end of Southwark Bridge - is a place of petty thieves and criminals, of poverty, \"mean little dodges\" and scams. Waters's Victorian London is a city where thieves say \"fuck\" and \"cunt\", where babies are dosed with gin until they conk out, where \"knifish\" boys sit by the fire spitting out peanut shells. Most brutal, daring and refreshing of all, it's a place where pornography, emotional abuse and rape are the natural bedfellows of greed and lovelessness. The people, too, come throbbing off the page - none of your watery heroines here. Sue, 17, knows only that her mother was hanged for murder. She's been brought up by Mrs Sucksby and Mr Ibbs - the latter fences stolen property and the former does much the same with unwanted babies. It's a rough, crooked yet comradely household, which is occasionally visited by one Richard Rivers, a debonair criminal, forger and seducer. And Gentleman - as he's known - has a plan. An heiress, Maud Lilly, lives with her grim, scholarly uncle in a huge, dark mansion \"out Maidenhead-way\". Like that woman in white, Maud stands to inherit a fortune if and when she marries. Posing as a drawing master, Gentleman has already gained her trust and is confident that his attentions are welcomed. He now plans to lure her away from uncle, marry, \"jiggle\" and ruin her, before dumping her in an asylum and making her fortune his own. But in order to persuade this isolated young woman to \"do a flit\", he needs likeable, guileless Sue to become her lady's maid, so gaining her trust and helping her (and him). If they succeed, Sue will get a share of the fortune. Sue - good-hearted but crooked, with an eye on the main chance - doesn't think twice. Arriving in the country at this sprawling Gothic mansion, she gets to know lonely Maud and, gradually, to like her; an uneasy development in the light of what must happen. But Gentleman arrives and continues his sly courtship, and all seems to be going to plan. Until something Sue discovers, something she could never have predicted, flips her world over and turns it upside down. It was then that the book and I disappeared to a caf\u00e9 for several hours while the world thought I was working - Debenhams all over again. It's also the point, only a third of the way through this dense 400-pager, after which I refuse to disclose another morsel of plot. Even by admitting my excitement, I feel I've already said too much. It's a thriller, yes, but it's also a love story - a sexy, passionate and startling one. I hesitate to call it lesbian, because that seems to marginalise it far more than it deserves. Suffice to say, it is erotic and unnerving in all the right ways. And modern - though Waters makes full and sensuous use of gloves, stockings, rustling skirts and heaving breasts, her ear for the crunch of language, her knowingness and her unceasing impulse for physical honesty turn every potential clich\u00e9 into something up-close and fresh. I was occasionally aware of Waters's unstoppable appetite for detail, her determination to draw out every moment. Could it, should it, perhaps have been edited a little? But if the writer and critic in me asked these questions, the reader never did, not for a single moment. In fact, the last 50 pages are so sensationally tense that you read them naughtily, one eye on the sentence in hand, the other attempting vainly to cheat and flick ahead. There are always novels that you envy people for not yet having read, for the pleasures they still have to come. Well, this is one. Long, dark, twisted and satisfying, it's a fabulous piece of writing, but Waters's most impressive achievement is that she also makes it feel less like reading, more like living: an unforgettable experience.TopicsBooksFictionSarah WatersreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

You thought it would be terrible; it is merely squalid and boring. It is the peculiar lowness of poverty that you discover first; the shifts that it puts you to, the complicated meanness, the crust-wiping.\"Almost 70 years after George Orwell's observations were published in Down and Out in Paris and London, poverty remains a complex, difficult and unattractive subject. Our celebrity-obsessed press rarely ventures into the parallel universe of the terminally unglamorous, which is why these two books deserve praise for attempting to lay bare the grim banality of a breadline existence through good, old-fashioned investigative reporting.To find out whether people can actually survive on a wage of $7 an hour, as millions of Americans must, journalist Barbara Ehrenreich spent months doing unskilled labour, telling bosses she was a divorced housewife returning to employment, and renting the cheapest accommodation she could find.In Key West, Florida, she worked as a waitress and couldn't even afford to live on a caravan site: \"It is a shock to realise that 'trailer trash' has become, for me, a demographic to aspire to,\" she writes. She soon discovered that one wage wouldn't cover her bills and took a second job, as an estimated 7.8m others do in the US, getting by on caffeine and ibuprofen. Ultimately she walked out in tears. She went on to toil as a cleaner and a shop assistant at Wal-Mart, where she found she couldn't even afford to buy discounted clothes from the store she worked in.Ehrenreich has a forensically observant yet sympathetic style. It's the small details that make the strongest impact - the \"citrus fart\" odour of a cheap restaurant; the frustrations of picking pubic hairs out of a jacuzzi; the bizarre personality tests job applicants have to take; the anti-union video shown to new Wal-Mart staff.She suffers bullying managers, spying householders, rude customers, institutionalised humiliation, back pain and skin rashes - although she admits that her investigation could never tell her what it was really like to live in poverty, without hope of respite: \"I was only visiting a world that others inhabit full-time.\"This world, she says, is a dictatorship, where companies intimidate their employees, through drug tests, surveillance and public admonishments, into quiescent acceptance of their meagre lot - which is why so few dare to rebel.Fran Abrams's book grew out of her series of Guardian reports inspired by Ehrenreich's project. Abrams worked as a cleaner in London's Savoy hotel, earning \u00a34 an hour and living in a smelly, bug-infested bedsit, and found how employers of casual workers mercilessly skim their wages with a variety of scams - sundry deductions, unpaid breaks and \"training\", withheld overtime.She then temped in a sauce factory in Doncaster, and near Aberdeen as a care assistant in a down-at-heel old people's home. As in Nick Davies's and Nick Danziger's illuminating books about Britain's underclass, she found resignation and despair, but also misplaced optimism and the gallows humour of the terminally screwed. She witnessed no headline-grabbing horrors, no drug addiction or homelessness, but rather a fraught, pinched world of stifled potential and permanently lowered horizons.Low pay inevitably equals bad housing, poor diet and deteriorating health; this, too, has not changed since Orwell's time. Outside London, Abrams found it easier to live on the money, but only just. Although the comparison between these two books leaves Britons with much to be thankful for, particularly our welfare system and health service, there is also much to fear. Privatisation and PFI schemes have boosted the growing phenomenon of casual labour. The unions have not adapted to the new working landscape, leaving millions unrepresented and vulnerable. The demise of social housing has allowed the poor to be gouged by free-market landlords.In order that we can live more cheaply and easily, and so that companies can profit, workers must bear the human cost. New Labour, to its credit, has at least made attempts to assist the \"working poor\", but the minimum wage and the Working Families Tax Credit are nowhere near enough to address the enormity of the problem. These books would make salutary reading for every cabinet minister.\u00b7 Matthew Collin is a former editor of The Big IssueTopicsBooksHigher educationSociety booksMinimum wagereviewsReuse this contentEducationSchoolsTeachersUniversitiesStudentsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The title invokes 9/11, but the novel is set 60 years ago. The plot against America isn't Islamic but homegrown (with a little assistance from Germany). And instead of reconstructing real historical events, as David Hare does in Stuff Happens, Philip Roth offers something bolder: a reconstruction of imagined events, a \"what if...?\" that reads like a \"what really happened\". Just suppose...that the air hero Charles Lindbergh, the man who made the first solo transatlantic flight in 1927, who earned huge sympathy when his baby son was kidnapped and murdered five years later, who called Hitler \"a great man\" and was decorated by order of the F\u00fchrer for his services to the Reich, just suppose that he'd taken up Republican invitations to run for president in November 1940, and milked the isolationist sentiment that undoubtedly existed then (No more war! Never again will young Americans die on foreign soil!), and that instead of Roosevelt being elected for an unprecedented third term and taking America into Europe to fight the Nazis, Lindbergh won a landslide victory. And then he signed non-aggression treaties with Germany and Japan, and set about realising his vision of America as a land of the brave and blond, and introduced a set of anti-semitic measures which, if not on the scale of Hitler's pogroms, were a betrayal of the rights and liberties enshrined in the constitution and yet, such was the young president's charisma, they were accepted by the mass of ordinary citizens and even by some prominent Jews. Just suppose...that the princes in the Tower hadn't been murdered, that Britain had remained a republic after Cromwell, that America had turned fascist in 1940. In most hands, \"just suppose\" is a parlour game, a high-table diversion, whimsical and ultimately trivial. Not with Roth. His stroke of genius - and, given the extraordinary late blooming of an already illustrious career with American Pastoral, I Married a Communist and The Human Stain, the word genius doesn't seem excessive - is to bed his little fantasy in the rich soil of his own childhood in Newark, New Jersey, and watch it grow. The narrator is Philip Roth, aged seven, and the family at the book's centre are his family - father Herman, mother Bess and brother Sandy. The Roths understand the threat posed by Lindbergh, as do their Jewish neighbours, but each member of the family responds differently. Early on, there's a trip to see the sights of Washington, where the Roths find their pre-booked hotel room has become mysteriously unavailable. A blatant case of anti-semitism, Herman shouts, and a violation of the Gettysburg principle that \"All men are created equal\". But his loudmouth protests embarrass Bess and silence their voluble tour-guide. Already there's a pressure to pretend not to see what's going on. Further frictions arise when, under the auspices of a scheme called \"Just Folks\", Sandy disappears for the summer for an \"apprenticeship\" with a Kentucky tobacco farmer. A talented young artist, he returns with a portfolio of animal sketches - and a sudden enthusiasm for Waspish, heartland values. Worse, he's co-opted by the OAA (the Office of American Absorption) to encourage other Jewish city boys to follow his example - and does it so well that through his aunt, Bess's sister Evelyn (whose boyfriend, Rabbi Bengelsdorf, is a passionate supporter of Lindbergh), he's invited to a reception at the White House. A fierce row ensues, with Herman refusing Sandy permission to attend and Evelyn and the rabbi defending Lindbergh as a freely elected democrat \"who has exhibited not a single inclination towards authoritarian rule\". In noisily denouncing Lindbergh, Herman is made to feel like a \"frightened, paranoid ghetto Jew\". Paranoia is a common issue with Roth's narrators, who're frequently told they're imagining or exaggerating things - there's a memorable scene in The Counterlife, when a woman in a London restaurant complains to the waiter of the terrible smell in the place and the hero, Nathan Zuckerman, tells his disbelieving gentile wife \"I am that stink\". The thesis of The Plot Against America is paranoid, too - a fascistic US government suspending civil liberties and persecuting minorities deemed a threat to security. Paranoid and yet (even without any allusion to America post-9/11) utterly plausible. To make alternative history credible, you have to register the incredulity of those it's happening to. \"We knew things were bad,\" Herman tells friends after his hotel experience in Washington, \"but not like this. You had to be there to see what it looked like.\" Later, after Von Ribbentrop is warmly greeted at the White House, Herman says: \"If I didn't see it with my own eyes, I'd think I was having a hallucination.\" Or later still:\"It can't happen here? My friends, it is happening here.\" What unfolds requires some tweaking of the historical record - the postponement of Pearl Harbor by a year, for instance. But so inevitable is the march of events that this is all it seems, a tweak. It helps that we see things through the eyes of a child. The man the child became can look back at what was lost (\"that huge endowment of personal security I had taken for granted as an American child of American parents in an American school in an American city in an America at peace with the world\"), but the child, in medias res, is preoccupied by matters other than politics: his stamp collection, for instance; or how his Aunt Evelyn, holed up in the cellar, will get through the night without access to a toilet; or what to make of his repellently fascinating cousin Alvin, who has come home from the war in Europe minus a leg. But even those postage stamps lose their innocence. Philip dreams of their national park icons being covered by swastikas, and when the collection is eventually lost, anti-semitism is directly to blame: under the new Homestead 42 scheme, the Roths have been \"selected\" for relocation to Kentucky, and it's while running away in the middle of the night to avoid exile that Philip mislays his most treasured possession. As it turns out, the Roths avoid the ultimate catastrophe. But Philip's worst-best friend Seldon is less fortunate. There's a hauntingly familiar moment when Seldon, at home alone in Kentucky when his mother Selma fails to return from work, is given painstaking instructions by Philip's mother over the phone from Newark on how to make himself toast for supper. Seldon fears the worst (\"Now both my parents are dead\") and he's right to. By this point, two years into Lindy's presidency, killings and riots have begun and many Jews are fleeing over the border into Canada. The nadir is the assassination of the Jewish journalist and broadcaster Walter Winchell, a prominent critic of government policy. In truth, as we learn from Roth's postscript, Winchell lived on for 30 more years. But the alternative history which Roth imagines for him, including a detailed account of his vast funeral in 1942, seems more realistic than the reality of Winchell becoming a McCarthyite in the 50s and dying in obscurity. The postscript, with its short biographies and list of sources, gives us the facts - the ground on which Roth has built his house of fiction. It's instructive yet also redundant. What matters isn't the reality that underpins the novel, but the reality it creates for itself. And The Plot Against America creates its reality magisterially, in long, fluid sentences that carry you beyond scepticism and with a quotidian attentiveness to sights and sounds, tastes and smells, surnames and nicknames and brandnames - an accumulation of des petits faits vrais - that dissolves any residual disbelief. Young Philip's greatest epiphany is to recognise the difference between history as taught in school - harmless and inevitable - and history as it's lived through, \"the relentless unforeseen\". His novel is a different kind of history again, an imagined past which, if we learn from it, might save us from a calamitous future. It's not Roth's funniest novel (and there's hardly any sex). But in its sweep and chutzpah, it ranks with his great trilogy of the late-90s. Isn't it time they gave him the Nobel? &#183Blake Morrison's Things My Mother Never Told Me is published by VintageTopicsBooksFictionPhilip RothreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Her second novel, Half of a Yellow Sun, takes its title from the emblem for Biafra, the breakaway state in eastern Nigeria that survived for only three years, and whose name became a global byword for war by starvation. Adichie's powerful focus on war's impact on civilian life, and the trauma beyond the trenches, earns this novel a place alongside such works as Pat Barker's Regeneration trilogy and Helen Dunmore's depiction of the Leningrad blockade, The Siege.Adichie takes her time in reaching the privations of war. Covering the decade to the end of the Nigeria-Biafra war of 1967-70, the novel first develops its characters in a period of peace and - for some - plenty after Nigerian independence in 1960. Among the protagonists are Odenigbo, or \"the Master\", a radical maths lecturer at the University of Nsukka - in what became the secessionist Igbo land - and Ugwu, the village teenager who becomes his houseboy, but whom he enrolls at the university staff school. A novel that descends into dire hunger begins with Ugwu's devoted creativity in the kitchen, confecting pepper soup, spicy jollof rice and chicken boiled in herbs. Beer and brandy flow as he serves the Master's friends while absorbing snippets of intellectual debate in the era of Sharpeville, de Gaulle in Algeria and the struggle for US civil rights.Ugwu's domain is encroached upon by Odenigbo's lover, Olanna, the London-educated daughter of a \"nouveau riche\" businessman in Lagos, and the household is later disrupted by its links with Olanna's periodically estranged twin sister Kainene and her English boyfriend, Richard.Ethnic differences are signalled between the mainly Igbo protagonists - whose persistent switching between English and Igbo languages is wonderfully conveyed - and those such as Odenigbo's Yoruba colleague, Miss Adebayo, and Olanna's ex-boyfriend from the north, the Hausa prince Mohammed. These differences assume lethal significance after the ostensibly Igbo-led 1966 military coup, which becomes a pretext for anti-Igbo pogroms after the counter-coup six months later. As Olanna and others become caught up in the violence, the novel captures horror in the details of \"vaguely familar clothes on headless bodies\", or corpses' \"odd skin tone - a flat, sallow grey, like a poorly wiped blackboard\".As Biafran secession \"for security\" brings a refugee crisis, a retaliatory Nigerian blockade and all-out war, and the world (bar Tanzania) refuses to recognise the fledgling state, the focus is on the characters' grief, resilience and fragmenting relationships. Tending her adopted daughter, Olanna endures the descent into one-room squalor, food-aid queues and air raids without self-pity. But there is anger at the \"bleakness of bombing hungry people\", and the deadly kwashiorkor, malnutrition that afflicts children, dubbed \"Harold Wilson syndrome\" for the former colonial power's complicity. While Ugwu's forced conscription involves him in an atrocity whose legacy is lasting shame, the issue of forgiveness between the twin sisters subtly echoes that of warring political groups.A history of colonisation is alluded to, not least in the tragicomic figure of Richard's anglophile servant Harrison, who prides himself on serving roast beef and rhubarb crumble, but adapts in wartime to roasting lizards and bush rats \"as though they were rack of lamb\". While Richard identifies with Biafra and intends to write the history of the war, it is Ugwu who takes up the pen and the mantle. As Richard concedes, \"The war isn't my story to tell really,\" and Ugwu nods. \"He had never thought that it was.\"There are other quiet revolutions in the novel. Odenigbo, the \"revolutionary freedom fighter\" with endless certainty and self-belief, succumbs to drink and despair, while the seemingly compliant Olanna draws on profound strengths. The master-servant relationship is upended, as the \"houseboy\" returns with fondness and irony the Master's way of addressing him as \"my good man\".The novel's structure, moving in chunks between the late and early 60s, is not without blips. At times I wondered how far Ugwu's omnivorous reading was reflected in his development. But these are quibbles in a landmark novel, whose clear, undemonstrative prose can so precisely delineate nuance. There is a rare emotional truth in the sexual scenes, from Ugwu's adolescent forays and the mature couples' passions, to the ugliness of rape.Literary reflections on the Biafra war have a long and distinguished history, from the most famous poet to have died in the war, Christopher Okigbo, to Chinua Achebe, Cyprian Ekwensi and Flora Nwapa. Born in 1977, Adichie is part of a new generation revisiting the history that her parents survived. She brings to it a lucid intelligence and compassion, and a heartfelt plea for memory.\u00b7 Maya Jaggi was a judge of this year's Caine prize for African writing.

And you won't want to get off Buy Cloud Atlas at Amazon.co.ukBuy Cloud Atlas at Amazon.co.ukAS ByattSun 7 Mar 2004 01.56 AEDT Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell 544pp, Sceptre, \u00a316.99\nDavid Mitchell entices his readers on to a rollercoaster, and at first they wonder if they want to get off. Then - at least in my case - they can't bear the journey to end. Like Scheherazade, and like serialised Victorian novels and modern soaps, he ends his episodes on cliffhangers and missed heartbeats. But unlike these, he starts his next tale in another place, in another time, in another vocabulary, and expects us to go through it all again. Trust the tale. He reaches a cumulative ending of all of them, and then finishes them all individually, giving a complete narrative pleasure that is rare. The first tale is about a 19th-century American lawyer, Adam Ewing, crossing the Pacific in 1850, meeting Maoris and missionaries, a seedy English physician and some nasty sailors. The second is about a young British composer in 1931, who cons a dying genius into taking him on as an amanuensis, and then makes love to his wife and daughter. This narrator, Robert Frobisher, composes the Cloud Atlas Sextet \"for overlapping soloists\" on piano, clarinet, cello, flute, oboe and violin, \"each in its own language of key, scale and colour\". Frobisher's tale is told in a series of letters to his lover, Rufus Sixsmith, who later appears as a nuclear scientist in Reagan's California in the 1970s. This Californian thriller is the tale of Luisa Rey, a journalist who uncovers a corporate nuclear scandal and is at constant risk of assassination. The fourth voice is Timothy Cavendish, a 1980s London vanity publisher, trapped in an old people's home near Hull. The fifth is the pre-execution testimony of Sonmi-451, a cloned slave in some future state, who has acquired intelligence and vision. The sixth, and central one, is the storytelling voice of Zachry, a tribesman after the fall of the civilised world, who is back in the Pacific islands where the linear narrative began. The novel opens with one ship - the Prophetess - and ends with another ship that contains the survivors of Civ'lise, the Prescients. The stories are all very intensely first person - apart from \"Half-Lives - the First Luisa Rey Mystery\". Each has a charac ter with a birthmark like a comet, as though they might be different incarnations of the same soul or different forms of the same cloud of molecules, as we all are. They are linked by other artifices - Frobisher finds both parts of Adam Ewing's Pacific diary; Luisa Rey acquires both Frobisher's letters and a rare gramophone record of the Sextet ; Cavendish is sent \"The First Luisa Rey Mystery\" by its author; Sonmi's dying request is to watch an old half-viewed film of \"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\", to see what happened. Sonmi herself has become the goddess of the Valley Tribes of Zachry, although the Prescients - who have preserved a hologram of her \"orison\", or recorded testimony - say she was a \"freakbirthed human who died hun'erds o years ago\".\nCloud Atlas is powerful and elegant because of Mitchell's understanding of the way we respond to those fundamental and primitive stories we tell about good and evil, love and destruction, beginnings and ends. He isn't afraid to jerk tears or ratchet up suspense - he understands that's what we make stories for. Cavendish, considering \"The First Luisa Rey Mystery\", imagines a critic saying: \"But it's been done a thousand times before\", and snarls to himself, \"as if there could be anything not done a hundred thousand times between Aristophanes and Andrew Void-Webber! As if Art is the What, not the How!\" This is a half-truth - Cavendish has the limitations of his place in culture, history and this novel - but it does associate works of art, and novels, with the eternal recurrences of culture and human nature. Mitchell is indeed both doing what has been done a hundred thousand times before and doing it differently. He plays delicious games with other people's voices, ideas and characters. Adam Ewing has his secret sharer and his Billy Budd. Frobisher is an amoral aesthete out of Waugh and Powell, and Vyvyan Ayres, his elderly host and slave-driver, quotes Nietzsche with nasty, decadent charm. Cavendish is nasty (and insinuatingly sympathetic) in the way of the Amises and Burgess's Enderby, snarling with wit about disasters of transport and bodily malfunction. \"Luisa Rey\" is interesting because it uses the clich\u00e9s of the Chandler world of good cop against bad power, exacts the simple response with which we would read such a tale - narrative greed, simplified fear and sympathy - and at the same time (because of the context it is in) is more moving than it would be on its own. Luisa describes an interview she did with Hitchcock (who, she says, described his own works as rollercoasters), in which she \"put it to the great man, the key to fictitious terror is partition or containment: so long as the Bates Motel is sealed off from our world, we want to peer in, like at a scorpion enclosure. But a film that shows the world is a Bates Motel, well, that's ... the stuff of Buchloe, dystopia, depression.\" This observation is something that Mitchell understands and exploits - using the word partition in both its musical and fencing sense, to make a distance between us and the tense dramas and horrors he describes, to make us see everything. Sunt lacrimae rerum, as Frobisher says at the end of his tale. Another paradigm we are offered is the idea of another character, a scientist - shortly before he is blown to bits - that we exist for a brief moment inside a shell (like Russian dolls) of virtual pasts, one of which is also the real past, and another of virtual futures, one of which is the real future. \"Half-Lives\" is a knowing title, radiation and fiction combined. Fictive people are ghosts. The ghosts of the virtual future, paradoxically, have to be more concrete than those of the pasts, written and real, that we already know. Sonmi's Nea So Copros and Zachry's Sloosha's Crossin' are both recognisable dystopias, one technological and political (in the tradition of Orwell, Huxley, Alasdair Gray), the other post-technological primitivism (as in Riddley Walker, Golding, Ursula le Guin); and both work because of the joyful amplitude of Mitchell's inventiveness. He is good at imagining the details of these hypothetical lives - not only the food and the rituals, but the moral atmospheres and the automatic assumptions. But his great feat is the variation in rhythms, which sweeps away any readerly objection to yet another brave new world. Sonmi, the fabricant who learns nakedly and from scratch to think and feel, is oddly the most intelligent of all the characters. Zachry's rhythm of tribal anecdote is the most compelling. These two use old words and invented new ones which are a delight.\nCloud Atlas asks the simple questions of our own time, which has a Darwinian vision. A missionary explains to Adam Ewing, son of the American revolution, his idea of a \"ladder of civilisation\" that will extinguish those races unable to join progress. Zachry's tribesmen believe Sonmi was \"birthed by a god o' Smart named Darwin\". Humans, someone says, have the intelligence of gods and the souls of jackals. Greed will destroy the world. Ewing, at the end of the book which is close to its beginning, as it has come full circle, sees the \"natural\" ideas of dominance and fitness as \"the entropy written within our nature\". He has saved the life of the last Moriori tribesman, whose peaceable family were destroyed by Maori warriors. The Moriori saves him, and individual acts of heroism and rescue stand against tooth and claw across the narrative web. Ewing goes back to become an abolitionist. Sonmi is a (briefly) freed slave whose presence has its half-life after defeat. Zachry becomes again the last of his peaceful tribe, and its storytelling memory. Ewing also says that \"Belief is both prize and battlefield\", and what Mitchell does is embody simple beliefs and make them vital and important. Luisa is named after Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Rey, another tale of lives brought together in time and significance by convergent fates. It is a tougher, sparser book than I had remembered, and I had forgotten the character of the priest, who tries to find God's providence in the accidental deaths and is burned for blasphemy. There are recurrent abbesses in Cloud Atlas who resemble the abbess in Wilder's book, who watches over the harmed and the hurt. Both books can be read both ways - there is a hidden order, mimicked by, or revealed by, art, which makes sense of our brief lives. Or perhaps there is not any order, except at the molecular level. Perhaps there is only kindness and tears. \u00b7 AS Byatt's Little Black Book of Stories was published by Chatto last year.TopicsBooksFictionAS ByattDavid MitchellCloud AtlasreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianJoanna KavennaWed 12 Oct 2016 17.30 AEDTLast modified on Thu 22 Feb 2018 23.53 AEDTAli Smith\u2019s latest novel is billed as the first in a four-part series, Seasonal, with each novel to be named, as the title suggests, after a season: Smith seeks thus to explore \u201cwhat time is, how we experience it\u201d. This question \u2013 of the nature of time itself, and the nature of our experience of time \u2013 is ancient and baroque. We conduct our lives with reference to an agreed symbolical system, clock time, and yet there is also the wholly subjective experience of time \u2013 which the philosopher Henri Bergson called la dur\u00e9e or duration. As in: time flies when you\u2019re having fun.It is impossible to know precisely how other people experience time. Despite this indeterminacy, novelists convey invented characters through linear time and even seek to imagine their \u201cduration\u201d as well. The enterprise is very strange and, as Thomas Mann wrote in The Magic Mountain, \u201cit is clear that time, while the medium of the narrative, can also become its subject. Therefore, if it is too much to say that one can tell a tale of time, it is none the less true that a desire to tell a tale about time is not such an absurd idea.\u201d Smith has written and published very quickly \u2013 making Autumn the first \u201cpost-Brexit novel\u201d \u2013 and the galloping style and speed of composition fit with the central theme.Ali Smith: \u2018It\u2019s a pivotal moment\u2026 a question of what happens culturally when something is built on a lie\u2019Read moreSmith\u2019s most recent novel, the critically acclaimed and 2015 Baileys prize-winning How to Be Both, was an experiment in \u201cduration\u201d \u2013 the reader\u2019s. It is comprised of two stories, one set in 15th-century Italy, which we might call A; and the other in modern-day Britain, B. Two editions of this novel exist: in one, the order runs AB; in the other, BA. The reader can, if she has the inclination, read the novel in both orders, one after the other. However, owing to the ineluctable conditions of linearity, we can only experience the novel for the first time in one order or another, AB or BA. This seems to be very much the point.Autumn begins in a wild region of no-time, as Daniel Gluck dreams that he is young again, or dead: \u201cHe must be dead, he is surely dead, because his body looks different from the last time he looked down at it, it looks better, it looks rather good as bodies go \u2026 But pure joy! He\u2019d forgotten what it feels like, to feel.\u201d He feels stripped of all the \u201crotting rot \u2026 till everything is light as a cloud\u201d. Yet he understands that this state of pure being will not last, and, abruptly, we return to quotidian reality, where everyone is defined by numbers and fixed categories:\nIt is a Wednesday, just past midsummer. Elisabeth Demand \u2013 32 years old, no-fixed-hours casual contract junior lecturer at a university in London, living the dream, her mother says, and she is, if the dream means having no job security and almost everything being too expensive to do \u2026 has gone to the main Post Office in the town nearest the village her mother now lives in.\nElisabeth is defiantly reading Brave New World and waiting to apply for a new passport. The clock has stalled; miserable people queue alongside her, staring into space. \u201cCOMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY\u201d, thinks Elisabeth, citing Huxley. Inevitably, when she reaches the front of the queue, her application is rejected. Her photograph is \u201cthe wrong size\u201d, the man says. \u201cHe writes in a box \u2026 HEAD INCORRECT SIZE.\u201d Then, he \u201cfolds the Check & Send receipt and tucks it into the envelope Elisabeth gave him with the form \u2026 He hands it back to her across the divide. She sees terrible despondency in his eyes. He sees her see it. He hardens even more.\u201dAbandoning her doomed endeavour, Elisabeth goes to the Maltings Care Providers plc to see Gluck who, we discover, has been a close friend since she was a child. He is now 101 years old, and spends his days in \u201cthe increased sleep period\u201d that \u201chappens when people are close to death\u201d. \u201cHis eyes are closed and watery. There\u2019s a long time between each breath in and out. In that long time there\u2019s no breathing at all, so that every time he breathes out there\u2019s the possibility that he might not breathe in again.\u201dThe Only Blonde in the World, by Pauline Boty, 1963. Photograph: \u00a9 Estate of Pauline Boty/Courtesy TateIn a series of flashbacks, we discover how Elisabeth and Daniel first met, in 1993, when she was a child of eight and he was a venerable and intriguing neighbour. At the time, Daniel collected \u201carty art\u201d, including the work of real-life artist Pauline Boty. A founding figure in British pop art, Boty created subversive, witty paintings and collages until her premature death in 1966. She recurs through the novel, as a symbol of all those who are \u201cIgnored. Lost. Rediscovered years later. Then ignored. Lost. Rediscovered again years later. Then ignored. Lost. Rediscovered ad infinitum.\u201d Always, Smith\u2019s characters must rebel against other people\u2019s mantras about the world, their certainties. As a child, Elisabeth disobeyed her mother\u2019s injunction to stay away from Daniel. Boty refused to succumb to drab conventions about what artists who happen to be women might do.In the uneasy present of Smith\u2019s novel, the EU referendum has just occurred and Britain is full of \u201cpeople saying stuff to each other and none of it actually becoming dialogue\u201d:\nAll across the country, there was misery and rejoicing. All across the country, what had happened whipped about by itself as if a live electric wire had snapped off a pylon in a storm and was whipping about in the air above the trees, the roofs, the traffic. All across the country, people felt it was the wrong thing. All across the country, people felt it was the right thing. All across the country, people felt they\u2019d really lost. All across the country, people felt they\u2019d really won.\nThe atmosphere is sullen: \u201cThe whole city\u2019s in a storm at sea and that\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d Daniel sleeps through the turmoil, like Rip Van Winkle, dreaming of life and youth. Elisabeth imagines parallel realities, beyond all the contemporary vitriol, where Daniel is awake. In a flashback, Daniel says to Elisabeth: \u201cThe rain falls. The wind blows. The seasons pass \u2026 and the leaves from all the trees round about fall \u2026 and when the costumes have rotted away or been eaten clean by creatures happy to have the sustenance, there\u2019s nothing left of them, the pantomime innocents or the man with the gun, but bones in grass, bones in flowers, the leafy branches of the ash tree above them. Which is what, in the end, is left of us all, whether we carry a gun while we\u2019re here or we don\u2019t. So. While we\u2019re here. I mean, while we\u2019re still here.\u201dAli Smith: 'There are two ways to read this novel, but you're stuck with it \u2013 you'll end up reading one of them'Read moreIf time demolishes all things, then does the febrile, forlorn present matter anyway? Does anything matter \u2013 Elisabeth\u2019s friendship with Daniel, Boty\u2019s lost art, or the sorrowful bureaucrat in the post office? I think Smith is writing about finitude, and how life is fleeting, extraordinary and improbable, and yet unique mortals are trammelled by external edicts, forced to spend their time earning minimal wages, measuring passport photographs with a ruler.In her memory-scapes and dreamworlds, Smith reveals the buried longings of her characters; their agony, their hopeful eagerness, their fear of death. At one point, she imagines \u201call the things from the past \u2026 like a huge national orchestra biding its time \u2026 all the objects holding still and silent till the shops empty of people \u2026 Then, when darkness falls, the symphony \u2026 The symphony of the sold and the discarded. The symphony of all the lives that had these things in them once.

Photograph: Andre Chung/for The Washington PostSukhdev SandhuThu 8 Oct 2015 18.39 AEDTLast modified on Wed 29 Nov 2017 22.21 AEDTEver since 1976, when the US government officially recognised Black History Month, February has been a time \u2013 especially in state schools \u2013 to celebrate the emancipatory struggles of runaway slaves, pioneering medics and lawyers, and poets and \u201cfreedom riders\u201d. For the young Ta-Nehisi Coates, growing up in Baltimore, it was also a\u00a0time of mystification and shame. Watching newsreel footage of the civil rights movement, he got the impression that \u201cthe black people in these films seemed to love the worst things in life \u2013 love the dogs that rent their children apart, the tear gas that clawed at their lungs, the firehouses that tore off their clothes and tumbled them into their streets\u201d.These days, Coates is a prominent journalist for the Atlantic where his tendency to puncture sunny-side-up political platitudes has not abated. In\u00a0\u201cFear of a Black President\u201d (2012) he\u00a0wrote of Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cremarkable ability to soothe race consciousness among whites\u201d and how \u201cthis need to talk in dulcet tones, to never be angry regardless of the offence, bespeaks a strange and compromised integration\u201d. In 2014 he published \u201cThe Case for Reparations\u201d, a lengthy and widely debated essay in which he argued that\u00a0reparations would mean \u201ca revolution of the American consciousness, a\u00a0reconciling of our self-image as the great democratiser with the facts of our history\u201d.It is understandable, then, that there has been a lot of fanfare for Between the World and Me. It appears at a moment when, thanks to mobile phones and social media, the ghastly spectacle of black Americans \u2013 many of them young and unarmed \u2013 being strangled, clubbed or shot by police officers has created a\u00a0cacophony calling for change. Black Twitter, Black Lives Matter, hashtag activism: it is a marvellous noise, an\u00a0Occupy-style swarm energy that, for\u00a0veterans of an older media imperium, can appear befuddling. What they want is a figurehead, a mansplainer, a\u00a0gravitational node amid all these centrifugal conversations.They could certainly do a lot worse than Coates, whose book has already been lauded by Toni Morrison (\u201cI\u2019ve\u00a0been wondering who might fill the intellectual void that plagued me after James Baldwin died\u201d), and helped him to win a prestigious MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d award. A self-conscious step back from a present whose crimes and bloodiness it sees as consistent with American history, the volume is a rather strange blend of epistolary non-fiction, autobiography and political theory that has at its heart a simple message: \u201cIn America, it is traditional to destroy the black body \u2013 it is heritage.\u201dMany of the ideas Coates rehearses here are associated with the school of\u00a0thought known as Afro-pessimism. Black Americans were enslaved longer than they have been free, and as a\u00a0result the deaths of Eric Garner and Trayvon Martin are \u201cmerely the superlative form of a dominion whose prerogatives include friskings, detainings, beatings and humiliations\u201d. Later\u00a0he argues: \u201cThe plunder of black life was drilled into this country in its\u00a0infancy and reinforced across its history, so that plunder has become an\u00a0heirloom, an intelligence, a sentience, a default setting to which, likely to the end of our days, we must invariably return.\u201dProtesters march though the town of Sanford, Florida, seeking justice for the killing of Trayvon Martin, March 2012. Photograph: CorbisThese are all forceful claims \u2013 ones made with a characteristic pivoting towards the (male) black body and the frequent use of words such as \u201cplunder\u201d or \u201cshackle\u201d. They are accompanied by vivid recollections of growing up in gang-ridden West Baltimore where the local lads\u2019 uproarious nihilism is ascribed to the knowledge that \u201cwe could not get out\u201d and that \u201cthe ground we walked was tripwired\u201d.Coates is at his dreamiest when evoking his time at Howard University, a\u00a0historically black college in Washington, DC, that he calls \u201cthe Mecca\u201d. Cosmopolitan, teeming with \u201cPonzi schemers and Christian cultists, Tabernacle fanatics and mathematical geniuses\u201d, it\u2019s a place of self-discovery and self-invention, \u201ca machine crafted to capture and concentrate the dark energy of all African peoples\u201d. It is here\u00a0that he immerses himself in black literature and history, meets his future wife and befriends a middle-class student called Prince Jones who is later unlawfully killed by an undercover police officer.In part, the book is an ode to writing itself. Coates includes excerpts from Baldwin, Richard Wright and Sonia Sanchez as well as Nas and Ice Cube. He describes \u201cthe art of journalism\u201d as\u00a0\u201ca\u00a0powerful technology for seekers\u201d. And he remembers his time at Howard as being one where he learned the power of poetry as much as\u00a0of slogans, and that \u201cThe Dream thrives on generalisation, on limiting the number of possible questions, on privileging immediate answers.\u201dThe Dream is something Coates often invokes and damns as psychically disfiguring. The Dream, he explains, is\u00a0\u201cperfect houses with nice lawns. It is Memorial Day cookouts, block associations, and driveways \u2026 treehouses and the cub scouts. The Dream smells like peppermint but tastes like strawberry shortcake.\u201d It\u2019s hardly news that there are many tens of millions of Americans \u2013 of all colours \u2013 who have rarely had a whiff of this aroma. As such, the passage merely highlights the\u00a0inaudibility of class in this book. There is also precious little about Asians or Latinos, two other groups whose national identities have been scrambled and redefined by imperialism, internment and legally sanctioned alienation.Between the World and Me apparently came about when Coates asked his editor why no one wrote like Baldwin any more; his editor suggested he try. Borrowing the epistolary form of Baldwin\u2019s The Fire Next Time (1963), he\u00a0addresses it to his 14-year-old son Samori. But Coates doesn\u2019t write like a\u00a0father so much as an apprentice theologian or a sophomoric logician. Sentences begin with \u201cThus\u201d, \u201cI propose\u201d, \u201cThis leads us to another equally important ideal.\u201d The tone is consistently one of aspirational gravitas, of bewhiskered patriarchs and dollar-bill\u00a0overlords.A comparison with Coates\u2019s previous book, a 2008 memoir entitled The Beautiful Struggle, is telling. There he wrote about the world into which he grew up: \u201ccable and Atari plugged into every room, juvenile parenting, niggers sporting kicks with price tags that looked like mortgage bills\u201d. He believed in structural racism and enforced underdevelopment, but he described those forces in less portentous language: \u201cWe\u00a0thought all our battles were homegrown and personal, but, like an evil breeze at our back, we felt invisible hands at work, like someone was still tugging at levers and pulling strings.\u201d In 2015, Coates is a more exalted writer, but his prose seems increasingly ventriloquised and his insistence on\u00a0Afro-American exceptionalism a\u00a0kind of parochialism.

Publication of The Amber Spyglass completes Pullman's radical three-volume reworking of Paradise Lost. Readers who - noticing that it has taken him an extra year to publish the final volume - thought he might have lost the trail he took up in Northern Lights and The Subtle Knife need not have feared. If anything, The Amber Spyglass is more intense than its predecessors. The climaxes are bigger; there is a fresh fire in the writing; and there is a wonderful new cast of characters - notably, a pair of gay angels. Above all, Pullman pursues his central philosophical theme with even greater passion. In his world, the temptation and fall are not the source of all human misery but the end of repression by what he calls \"the Authority\" and the beginning of liberation and freedom of thought. What's more, it is Lyra and Will, two children on the threshold of growing up, whose embrace of knowledge saves the world, overturning the traditional view of childhood innocence. For those who don't know Pullman's Dark Materials, it is a single story published in three volumes - an exhilarating and poetic mixture of adventure, philosophy, myth and religion enriched by a heady brew of quantum physics. It is heavily influenced by Milton and Blake, but also by Swift, Goethe, Norse legend and Greek tragedy. Central to the story are Pullman's life-affirming belief in free will and the power of scientific rationalism and his deep dislike of hierarchical religion and the repression it sanctions. The first two volumes have already been dismissed as \"the stuff of nightmares\" by the Catholic Herald. Pullman won't be drawn into a theological debate, insisting that he is not setting down an argument or writing a philosophical treatise but telling a story. This is a touch disingenuous and Pullman knows it, since he insists that his story, despite its parallel worlds and huge host of ingenious characters, is not a fantasy. It is, he says, \"stark realism. The only thing that is interesting about fantasy is if you can use it to say something truthful and realistic about human nature.\" In his universe, for instance, everyone has a \"daemon\"; an aura or alter ego signifying their true soul, which may change in childhood but becomes fixed in adults. Through his portrayal of real people dealing with weighty moral issues within a mythic story and in a fantasy setting, Pullman has rearranged the landscape of writing for children. His central characters, Lyra and Will, have fantastical adventures, but their success within them comes from knowing what is true and what is real. It is knowledge, not fate, that shapes their destiny. Pullman's insistence on truth to human nature lies behind his dismissal of the fantasy writers to whom he is often compared: JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis. \"I dislike them for different reasons. The Lord of the Rings, for all its scope, weight and structural integrity, is not a serious book because it doesn't say anything interesting or new or truthful about human beings. It tells an essentially trivial story. The goodies are always good and the baddies are always bad. CS Lewis comes from a different tradition: in the Narnia books he struggles with big ideas. I dislike the conclusions he comes to because he seems to recommend the worship of a god who is a fascist and a bully; who dislikes people of different colours; and who thinks of women as being less valuable in every way. \"And it is a god who hates life because he denies children life. In the final Narnia book he gives the children the end-of-term treat of being killed in a railway accident so they can go to heaven. It's a filthy thing to do. Susan is shut out from salvation because she is doing what every other child who has ever been born has done - she is beginning to sense the developing changes in her body and its effect on the opposite sex. For all those reasons I profoundly disagree with Lewis and with the conclusions he reaches.\" The conclusion Pullman has come to is that people have within them the capacity to react and respond in a number of ways. His characters change; they make choices. His children, especially, are neither all good nor all bad. Lyra has spent a lifetime lying but it doesn't stop her having integrity when she needs it; Will has killed a man. \"I'm not dewy-eyed about children like Kenneth Grahame or AA Milne. I spent too long as a teacher,\" he says. \"I'm clear-eyed about them. I like the current, non- sentimental writing for children of authors like Anne Fine and Jacqueline Wilson, where they can be good and bad. I also value the process of growing up. It's an unavoidable fact that we're going to grow up. But that's hopeful.\" TopicsChildren and teenagersPhilip PullmanreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The fish, Sebald begins,\"had doubtless lain entombed in the deep-freeze for years... The breadcrumb armour-plating had been partly singed by the grill, and the prongs of my fork bent on it... The tartare sauce was turned grey by the sooty breadcrumbs.\" When the narrator finally manages to bite into his fillet, he finds \"nothing but an empty shell\". To load a bad meal in a small English town with so much morbid imagery takes a certain confidence. But so hypnotic were Sebald's sentences, and so suggestive the connections he kept making between his depressed narrator's minor wanderings and whole galaxies of grim forgotten history, that it was easy to go along with the book's relentless melancholy. At times, it was delicious; the text even came with attractively faded photographs of ruins and wintry beaches.\nAusterlitz is just as bleak and self-contained a work, only longer. Its main protagonist is an elderly architectural historian, Jacques Austerlitz. He lives in a barely described, vaguely contemporary east London. He has \"devoted almost the whole of his life to the study of books\", and to blotting out the horrors of his upbringing. This, we gradually learn, involved the Holocaust, the destruction of his original childhood world in Czechoslovakia, and his deportation to a chilly foster family in Wales. The story of it all comes framed by a second, anonymous narrator, who may or may not be Sebald himself, and who meets the old academic at mysterious intervals. As before, the precise ratio of fiction to non-fiction here is tantalisingly unclear. Real places and events drift across the smooth surface of Sebald's prose, its immense sentences marshalled by waves of commas, but so do dreams and speculations. Tremendous but conventional travel writing - Brussels rooftops \"crammed together like pack ice\", the Thames \"black as cart-grease\" - can turn into talk of ghosts and time travel and back again without the intervention of a full stop. There are no paragraph breaks, and there is no conventional direct speech. The reader, at times, has to suspend a considerable amount of disbelief. The plot, as much as there is one, progresses as a series of epiphanies: the infant Austerlitz in Prague, watching from a balcony as a tailor eats his nightly supper in a workshop below; the young Austerlitz sighting the Welsh coast after a winter confined inland with his foster parents; the middle-aged Austerlitz replaying a Nazi propaganda film about a Czech ghetto in slow motion, looking for his mother's face. This continuously heightened tone can be exhausting, like reading the best, climactic moments of dozens of novels one after the other. There is no restraint, either, in the frequency with which Sebald introduces his favourite themes and symbols. As in his other books, there is much lingering in derelict places, long trance-like walks are always being taken, and characters are constantly afflicted by headaches and feelings of dread. Given the minutely controlled rhythms and structures of his writing, it seems unlikely that Sebald failed to notice the closeness of parts of this novel to self-parody. From the first page, it is as if he were offering a challenge: follow my obsessions, or give up now. The characters and atmospheres are really vehicles for a worldview. \"In any project we design,\" as Austerlitz puts it, \"the absolute perfection of the concept... in practice... must coincide with its chronic dysfunction.\" Near the start, between reminiscences, Austerlitz gives a characteristically extended lecture about the 19th-century fortification of Antwerp. Each time a new ring of forts was built around the city, he explains, advances in siege techniques made them obsolete, so the Belgians commissioned further defences, whose very complexity ensured that they would never be finished before they became redundant. The final fort sat squat and useless until the second world war, when the Germans turned it into a concentration camp. Sebald and his characters are fixated by history, and by that of 19th-century Europe in particular, for the lessons it carries about how apparent rationalism can turn monstrous. In this, as in the book's use of flashbacks, ominous journeys and panoramic descriptions, there are strong echoes of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. And for all the uniquely lulling rhythm of Sebald's sentences and the trademark eerie precision of his language - his Antwerp fort has \"limbs and claws\" - other influences, too, begin to suggest themselves. The sense here of people being dwarfed and oppressed by systems is familiar from Kafka and Foucault: even the libraries where the narrators loiter are depicted as infinitely oppressive institutions. Similarly, Sebald's use of history and architectural detail, biography and travelogue, is brilliant, but less original than his admirers like to suggest. Iain Sinclair has been managing the same fusion for decades. Two years ago the film-maker Patrick Keiller published a book called Robinson in Space , with an architectural historian as a protagonist, a possibly autobiographical narrator to set down his theories, and enigmatic photos to record their melancholy travels around England. None of this is to suggest that Sebald should switch to writing football novels. The territory he is exploring - the significance of place, you could call it - is much too big and interesting not to be shared with others. And Sebald's intentions, unlike those of his counterparts, are as much emotional as intellectual. The erudition always comes with a sense of human frailty attached: Austerlitz loses himself in architectural theories as an escape from his past; he and other characters spend too much time reading, and have trouble with their eyes; the very length and detail of the novel's descriptions and digressions hint at the impossibility of ever fully understanding the world. And the book is also, after all, the story of a life. It includes passages with the rawness of a rare, good memoir, and the momentum of - rarer still - a convincing historical epic. There is even a wide-screen battle scene, as Austerlitz listens to his boarding-school history teacher recount the Napoleonic War confrontation of the same name: \"The Russian and Austrian troops had come down from the mountain sides like a slow avalanche... I see cannonballs suspended for an eternity in the air... victims flinging up their arms as they slide...\" Often, reading Sebald does not feel like reading about the past, as much as seeing the world through the eyes of someone from the past. The sepia language and the ease of reference to Victorian bodies of knowledge can make you wonder, sometimes, whether the author is actually some sort of ghost. Whenever a character encounters anything modern, which is not often, the usually all-seeing Sebald eye does not bother to record much detail. Or it simply turns away, bewildered. A block of flats is merely \"towering\", while tiny moths (a favoured motif) have \"collars and cloaks, like elegant gentlemen on their way to the opera\". Of course, Sebald is really a professor of literature in his late 50s at the University of East Anglia. He enjoys taking his dog for walks, he said recently in an interview. Yet the otherworldliness of his writing, the way each of his books seems to form a completely enclosed universe, makes what he publishes unusually seductive, compared to a lot of current British fiction at least, with its flat transatlantic phrases and desperation for reader empathy. Whether this makes Sebald a genius or not may depend on your appetite for descriptions of crumbling railway stations.TopicsBooksFictionreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In the days when their guardians were much stricter, the school myth goes, a boy's body was found there with its hands and feet removed. Sometimes that dark, threatening fringe of trees can cast such a shadow over the whole school that a pupil who has offended the others might be hauled out of bed in the middle of the night, forced to a window, and made to stare out at it.When not applying peer pressure in this curious way, Hailsham children seem to have a nice life. The school places considerable emphasis on self-expression through art and, especially, on staying healthy. There are frequent, exhaustive medical check-ups. Smoking is a real crime, because of the way it can damage your body. Yet despite the care lavished on them, their world has a puzzlingly second-hand feel. Everything they own is junk. Teaching aids are rudimentary. Sometimes you get the feeling they're being taken care of on the cheap.In fact, they are; and their fear of the woods reflects, in a distorted but fundamentally accurate way, their fate. They're organ donors, cloned to be broken up piecemeal for spares. The purpose of Hailsham is to prepare them for their future - to help instal the powerful mechanisms of self-repression and denial that will keep them steady and dependable from one donation to the next.Never Let Me Go is the story of Kathy and Tommy and Ruth, and of the love-triangle they begin at Hailsham. Ruth is the controlling one, Tommy is the one who used to find it hard to keep his temper: they hope that love will save them. They've heard that love - or art, or both - will get you a deferral. Kathy - well, Kathy is a carer by nature as well as profession: she watches her friends break themselves against the inevitable, but never lets them go. After Hailsham, they grow from puzzled children to confused young adults. They live in a prolonged limbo, waiting for the call to donate. They're free to wander. They write essays, continue with their artwork, learn to drive, roam Britain looking for their \"possibles\" - the real human beings they might have been cloned from.Their lack of understanding of the world is funny and touching. They stare into the window of an ordinary office, fascinated by the clean modern space. \"It's their lunch break,\" Tommy says reverently of the office workers, \"but they don't go out. Don't blame them either.\" The clones look in at the society that made them, failing to understand its simplest social and economic structures.As readers we're in a similar position. What Kathy doesn't know, we have to guess at. This sometimes excruciating curiosity propels us along; meanwhile, Ishiguro's careful, understated narration focuses on the way young people make a life out of whatever is on offer. Nothing is more heartbreaking than received wisdom, and Hailsham students, carefully sheltered not just from any real understanding of their fate but from any real understanding of the world in which it will be acted out, have nothing else to go on.Their sense of suspension, in a present where they neither make nor understand the rules, is pervasive. Childishly snobbish about the proprieties, they're as puzzled by what's proper as anyone else. Small fashions of behaviour come and go. Far into adulthood Kathy, Tommy and Ruth dissimulate and bicker and set teenage behavioural traps for one another.Inevitably, it being set in an alternate Britain, in an alternate 1990s, this novel will be described as science fiction. But there's no science here. How are the clones kept alive once they've begun \"donating\"? Who can afford this kind of medicine, in a society the author depicts as no richer, indeed perhaps less rich, than ours?Ishiguro's refusal to consider questions such as these forces his story into a pure rhetorical space. You read by pawing constantly at the text, turning it over in your hands, looking for some vital seam or row of rivets. Precisely how naturalistic is it supposed to be? Precisely how parabolic? Receiving no answer, you're thrown back on the obvious explanation: the novel is about its own moral position on cloning. But that position has been visited before (one thinks immediately of Michael Marshall Smith's savage 1996 offering, Spares). There's nothing new here; there's nothing all that startling; and there certainly isn't anything to argue with. Who on earth could be \"for\" the exploitation of human beings in this way?Ishiguro's contribution to the cloning debate turns out to be sleight of hand, eye candy, cover for his pathological need to be subtle. So what is Never Let Me Go really about? It's about the steady erosion of hope. It's about repressing what you know, which is that in this life people fail one another, grow old and fall to pieces. It's about knowing that while you must keep calm, keeping calm won't change a thing. Beneath Kathy's flattened and lukewarm emotional landscape lies the pure volcanic turmoil, the unexpressed yet perfectly articulated, perfectly molten rage of the orphan.By the final, grotesque revelation of what really lies ahead for Kathy and Tommy and Ruth, readers may find themselves full of an energy they don't understand and aren't quite sure how to deploy. Never Let Me Go makes you want to have sex, take drugs, run a marathon, dance - anything to convince yourself that you're more alive, more determined, more conscious, more dangerous than any of these characters.This extraordinary and, in the end, rather frighteningly clever novel isn't about cloning, or being a clone, at all. It's about why we don't explode, why we don't just wake up one day and go sobbing and crying down the street, kicking everything to pieces out of the raw, infuriating, completely personal sense of our lives never having been what they could have been.\u00b7 M John Harrison's latest novel is Light (Gollancz)TopicsBooksBooker prize 2005Awards and prizesFictionKazuo IshiguroBooker prizereviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Ulf Andersen/Getty ImagesAli SmithSat 16 Apr 2005 10.01 AESTGileadby Marilynne Robinson282pp, Virago, \u00a314.99The American writer Marilynne Robinson has been revered for years as the author whose astonishing debut, Housekeeping, published in 1981, was an instant classic. Written in a rich and distilled prose, this beautifully made story of two girls brought up by their drifter aunt in a small American town called Fingerbone, was mesmerising about the brevity of life and the seductive longevity of story. It focused on \"the life of perished things\", resaw convention as a gravely thin survival tactic, made a new mythology of transience and gave revitalised meaning to the conjunction of words like haunting and fiction.Now, after 24 years, there's finally a second novel by Robinson, which has just won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Her only other books have been non-fiction - a collection of philosophical essays, The Death of Adam (2000) and a passionate polemic about Sellafield and the British nuclear industry, Mother Country (1989), in which she traced back to what she saw as its roots in British social history \"the knowing and calculated contamination, by the British government for profit, of a populous landscape, with the most toxic substance known to exist on earth\".A new novel from a writer whose only other is a classic signals an unfair inevitability of comparison alongside a great deal to live up to. The two novels have a lot in common, in particular a shared concern for the way that children inexorably disappear into their own futures, and a fascination with mortality. Both novels are about outsiders and what happens to them socially.But Gilead, a book about fathers and sons, where Housekeeping was a book about girls and women, and fragmentary where one of Housekeeping's achievements was its fluid narrative completeness, takes an opposing narratorial position with a protagonist whose insider credentials could not be stronger. In Genesis, in the story of Joseph, Gilead is the casually mentioned place left behind by the merchants who bought Joseph from his brothers. Robinson's Gilead is a small American town in Iowa in 1956. John Ames, a preacher in his mid-70s whose heart is failing him, is writing letters to his only child, now aged six, so that when the boy reaches an adulthood his father won't see, he'll at least have this posthumous one-sided conversation: \"While you read this, I am imperishable, somehow more alive than I have ever been.\"Ames is descended from preachers. He is old, vaguely Republican, delightfully lifeloving, sententious and irritatingly given to homily. He can on the one hand make water sound miraculous and on the other make a reader as nervous and fidgety as a long morning in church. He records, for his son, the details of an everyday life and his own stories of his pacifist father and abolitionist grandfather who could rouse a crowd to a \"good\" moral war; these stories are among the most vivid in the novel. Meanwhile, in the idyllic-seeming backwater, unaddressed and troubling issues of poverty and race emerge - though so gently as to be near invisible - especially when Ames's surrogate son, a traditional \"bad lot\", comes back to Gilead and circumstances invite comparison between 1950s social unacceptability and the abolitionist fervour of only a couple of generations ago. To say more here about the story would be to rip through something Robinson takes care to deliver with spider-web fineness.Gilead reads like something written in a gone time. So much so that when Ames's child draws Messerschmitts and Spitfires, it is actually shocking. This is part of its purpose, to be a conscious narration to the future from someone whose time was different and is over. \"I believe I'll make an experiment with candour here,\" Ames says in letters which will eventually reveal his own opacity, as Robinson discreetly disrupts the monology.Ames loves to question words; so does Robinson, whose novel shifts in a moment from discussions about cliche to the uses of dissent, and whose protagonist is a man who, when America joined the first world war, burnt his only real rollicking anti-war sermon because \"I knew the only people at church would be a few old women who were already about as sad and apprehensive as they could be and no more approving of the war than I was\". The word \"anger\" figures a lot in a book careful never to rise to it. Instead, it's a delicate arraignment. \"Maybe new wars have come along since I wrote this that have seemed brave to you. That there have been wars I have no doubt.\"A book about the damaged heart of America, it is part vibrant and part timeworn, a slow burn of a read with its \"crepuscular\" narrator, its repetitions, its careful languidity. It is not the literary equivalent of Robinson's first novel, but then, times have changed, and Gilead, which seems in some ways almost to resent being a novel at all, is perhaps more closely akin to Mother Earth's \"effort to break down some of the structures of thinking that make reality invisible to us\", than to the gorgeously evoked absences of Housekeeping. Not the most immediately prepossessing of subjects, it is not the most immediately prepossessing of novels.But in Gilead, Robinson is addressing the plight of serious people with a calm-eyed reminder of the liberal philosophical and religious traditions of a nation whose small towns \"were once the bold ramparts meant to shelter peace\", citing a tradition of intellectual discursiveness and a historical cycle that shifts from radical to conservative then back to radical again, and presenting, as if from the point of view of time's own blindness, an era when unthinkable things were happening but were themselves about to change unimaginably, for the better. It takes issue with the status quo by being a message, across generations, from a now outdated status quo. \"What have I to leave you but the ruins of old courage, and the lore of old gallantry and hope?\" Things can and will change; they have before, and they will again.TopicsMarilynne RobinsonFictionAli SmithreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Geoffrey Elton used to argue that he founded modern government, but later historians have pared back his role, and one recent biographer, Robert Hutchinson, portrayed him as a corrupt proto-Stalinist. He's a sideshow to Wolsey in Shakespeare and Fletcher's Henry VIII, a villain who hounds Thomas More to his death in Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons. Law and financial administration - his main activities - don't always ignite writers' imaginations, and in the pop-Foucauldian worldview of much historical fiction since the 1980s, his bureaucratic innovations would be seen as inherently sinister. Then there's the portrait of him, after Holbein: a dewlapped man in dark robes with a shrewd, unfriendly face, holding a folded paper like an upturned dagger. He looks, as Hilary Mantel has him say in her new novel, \"like a murderer\".In Wolf Hall, Mantel persuasively depicts this beefy pen-pusher and backstairs manoeuvrer as one of the most appealing - and, in his own way, enlightened - characters of the period. Taking off from the scant evidence concerning his early life, she imagines a miserable childhood for him as the son of a violent, drunken blacksmith in Putney. Already displaying toughness, intelligence and a gift for languages, he runs away to the continent as a boy of 15 or so (his date of birth isn't known, and in the novel he doesn't know it himself). At this point, only 16 pages in, the action cuts to 1527, with Cromwell back in England, \"a little over forty years old\" and a trusted agent of Cardinal Wolsey. His life-shaping experiences in France, Italy and the Netherlands are dealt with in flashback here and there: he has been a soldier, a trader and an accountant for a Florentine bank; he has killed a man and learned to appreciate Italian painting.Mantel's Cromwell is an omnicompetent figure, \"at home in courtroom or waterfront, bishop's palace or inn yard. He can draft a contract, train a falcon, draw a map, stop a street fight, furnish a house and fix a jury.\" Fluent in many languages, learned, witty and thoughtful, he's also an intimidating physical presence; Wolsey fondly compares him to \"one of those square-shaped fighting dogs that low men tow about on ropes\". This makes him an ideal emissary for Wolsey's project of liquidating some smaller monasteries to fund a school and an Oxford college. But self-advancement isn't Cromwell's only motive. He's disgusted by the waste and superstition he encounters, and takes a materialist view of relics and indulgences. The feudal mindset of Wolsey's rival grandees seems equally outdated to him: jibes at his lowly origins bounce off his certainty that noble blood and feats of arms now count for less than lines of credit and nicely balanced books.The first half of the novel, built around Wolsey's fall from power, details Cromwell's domestic setup at Austin Friars and introduces the major players in Tudor politics. Without clobbering the reader with the weight of her research, Mantel works up a 16th-century world in which only a joker would call for cherries in April or lettuce in December, and where hearing an unlicensed preacher is an illicit thrill on a par with risking syphilis. The civil wars that brought the Tudors to the throne still make older people shudder, bringing Henry's obsession with producing a male heir into focus. And the precarious nature of early modern life is brought home by the abrupt deaths of Cromwell's wife and daughters, carried off by successive epidemics in moving but unsentimentally staged scenes. Cromwell asks if he can bury his elder daughter with a copybook she's written her name in; \"the priest says he has never heard of such a thing\".Grieving, he thinks of Tyndale's banned English Bible: \"now abideth faith, hope and love, even these three; but the greatest of these is love.\" More, he knows, thinks \"love\" is \"a wicked mistranslation. He insists on 'charity' . . . He would, for a difference in your Greek, kill you.\" In the second half of the novel - which charts Cromwell's rise to favour as he clears the way for the king's marriage to Anne Boleyn - More emerges as Cromwell's opposite number, more a spokesman for another worldview than a practical antagonist. Shabbily dressed, genial, yet punctiliously correct on politically controversial points, this More is a far cry from Bolt's gentle humanist martyr. He's made repulsive even more by the self-adoring theatricality behind his modest exterior than by his interest in torturing heretics and contemptuous treatment of his wife. He ends up stage-managing his own destruction out of narcissism and fanaticism, or at best a cold idealism that's contrasted unfavourably with Cromwell's reforming worldliness.For all its structural and thematic importance, however, Cromwell's conflict with More is only part of a wider battle caused by Henry's desire to have his first marriage annulled. Much space is given over to court politics, which Mantel manages to make comprehensible without downplaying its considerable complexity. Central figures - the Boleyn sisters, Catherine of Aragon, the young Mary Tudor, the king himself - are brought plausibly to life, as are Cromwell's wife, Liz Wykys, and Cardinal Wolsey. Determined, controlled but occasionally impulsive, and a talented hater, Mantel's Anne Boleyn is a more formidable character even than her uncle the Duke of Norfolk, portrayed here as a scheming old warhorse who rattles a bit when he moves on account of all the relics and holy medals concealed about his person.Making characters of all these people is, of course, a big risk. How do you write about Henry VIII without being camp or breathless or making him do something clunkily non-stereotypical? Mantel attacks the problem from several angles, starting by knowing a lot about the period but not drawing attention to how strenuously she's imagining it. Meaty dialogue takes precedence over description, and the present-tense narration is so closely tied to the main character that Cromwell is usually called plain \"he\", even when it causes ambiguities. Above all, Mantel avoids ye olde-style diction, preferring more contemporary phrasing. Small rises in the level of language are frequently used for comic effect, as in: \"Well, I tell you, Lady Shelton, if she had had an axe to hand, she would have essayed to cut off my head.\" The effortless-seeming management of contrasting registers plays a big part in the novel's success, as does Mantel's decision to let Cromwell have a sense of humour.\"Love your neighbour. Study the market. Increase the spread of benevolence. Bring in better figures next year.\" If not a man for all seasons, the book's heroic accountant is surely the man for his season. Mantel keeps too close an eye on facts and emotions to make her story an arch allegory of modern Britain's origins, but her setting of such unglamorous virtues as financial transparency and legal clarity against the forces of reaction and mystification is interesting and mildly provocative. At the same time, sinister grace notes accompany Cromwell's triumph. Wolf Hall, the Seymour family seat, is a site of scandal in the novel, a place where men prey on women and the old on the young. It's also where Jane Seymour first caught Henry's eye - an event that falls just outside the book's time scheme, but which serves as a reminder that, whatever their status in 1535, most of the major characters will end up with their heads on the block.Mantel is a prolific, protean figure who doesn't fit into many of the established pigeonholes for women writers, and whose output ranges from the French revolution (A Place of Greater Safety) to her own troubled childhood (Giving Up the Ghost). Maybe this book will win one of the prizes that have been withheld so far. A historian might wonder about the extent to which she makes Cromwell a modern rationalist in Renaissance dress; a critic might wonder if the narrator's awe at the central character doesn't sometimes make him seem as self-mythologising as his enemies. But Wolf Hall succeeds on its own terms and then some, both as a non-frothy historical novel and as a display of Mantel's extraordinary talent. Lyrically yet cleanly and tightly written, solidly imagined yet filled with spooky resonances, and very funny at times, it's not like much else in contemporary British fiction. A sequel is apparently in the works, and it's not the least of Mantel's achievements that the reader finishes this 650-page book wanting more.TopicsHilary MantelFictionHistory booksWolf HallreviewsReuse this contentFilmMusicBooksTV & radioArt & designStageGamesClassicalNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usInformationContact usSecureDropVacanciesPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersEventsDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersGuardian LabsAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
